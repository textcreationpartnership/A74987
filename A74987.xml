            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being deſired that more might be publiſhed of the Works of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author, Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen;</hi> you have here ſome more Sermons taken from him in ſhort-hand, which have been tranſcribed with care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>The main points of the Goſpel are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in theſe Sermons; ſo that thoſe that Read them, may underſtand the Authors <hi>knowledg in the myſtery of Chriſt.</hi> And they are delivered with plainneſs of ſpeech, with words eaſie to be underſtood; ſo that it will eaſily appear, that his aim was to ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owerful, like an Ambaſſador of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons ariſe naturally from the Texts of Scripture they are upon: for it
<pb facs="tcp:151103:3"/> was not the manner of this Author, to name a Text only for faſhion ſake.</p>
            <p>One great cauſe of ignorance in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is, becauſe there is no more direct opening and applying the Scripture. The more Scripture is ſolidly opened, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically applied in a Sermon, the better the Sermon is, whatſoever the injudicious and ignorant do think to the contrary. Indeed as I never heard any man Pray too long at a time, ſo I never heard any man Preach too long upon a Text. But as many, that ſeem to pray long, do oftentimes rather Diſcourſe than Pray, and keep ſo little to the buſineſs of Prayer, that while they ſeem to Pray long, they Pray very little: So it is with ſome in Preaching, that though they name the ſame Text a great while, as if they Preached many Sermons from it, yet, it may be, Preach not one, according to the direct ſcope and tendency of the words they are upon. I take notice of this, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Author of theſe Sermons, as a pattern to young Preachers, not to think it any part of the excellency of their Sermons to take but a few words for their Text, or to be long upon the ſame words; but to open and apply as much Scripture as they can at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:151103:3"/> time, which will not only prevent many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences in Preaching: But when what is ſaid ariſeth immediately and naturally from the portion of Scripture handled, the people may take notice, that it is not ſo much the Miniſter, as God himſelf that ſpeaks theſe things to them in his word.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons alſo are Orthodox, ſound, <hi>according to the truth which is after godlineſs.</hi> We have lived in a time of an inundation of errors and hereſies, and yet the Lord hath continued the truth of the Goſpel in the <hi>Churches of the Saints.</hi> And although the Churches of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way have been looked upon by ſome as Seminaries of error; yet through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the midſt of them, the truth of the Goſpel hath continued in them, as well as in other Churches of Chriſt, that differ from them in ſome points of order and diſcipline. Bleſſed be the Father of lights, that hath kept the guides and members both of Congregational Churches, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Churches, ſtable and ſteady in the main truths of the Goſpel, which have been publickly owned and profeſſed in the Land ſince the reformation: whereas many others have been carried away with diverſe and strange Doctrines.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151103:4"/>
            <p>There ſeems to be a great conſpiracy in theſe days, againſt the Lord Jeſus as the Mediator between God and ſinners. Men are ſtudying how they may aſcribe as little to Chriſt as may be, to whom we are to aſcribe all, concerning the making atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſins, and the bringing in an everlaſting righteouſneſs to juſtifie us before God. Indeed Chriſt hath been ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Preached amongſt us, and many have ſuch outward advantage by a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his name, that they cannot well open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce him; yet they are ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the very fundamental points of our Religion. Many amongst us ſlight what hath been generally taught concerning our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> original ſin, Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſin, and the imputation of his righteouſneſs to them that believe on his name, and make a mock of being weary and heavy laden with the ſenſe of the wrath of God due to us for ſin, and looking to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as the Mediator, and reſting our weary Souls and perplexed Conſciences upon him as our only Saviour. Now if theſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be deſtroyed, if theſe main Doctrines be denied, we are really putting away the Lord Jeſus from us, though we uſe never
<pb facs="tcp:151103:4"/> ſo many external Rites to make ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his name. Yea, it is conſiderable, That this oppoſition to the main points of our Religion, is fiercey maintained by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons greatly differing in other things: yet in this they agree, and are very earneſt upon the matter to deny the Goſpel. I ſpeak of theſe things, to this end, to ſhew what great need there is of Preaching much of our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> of the corruption of our nature, of the ſentence of death, and condemnation that we are under for ſin, of the perſon and offices of Chriſt the Mediator, of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of knowing him, and fleeing for refuge unto him, as this Author hath excellently ſhewed in theſe Sermons, and ſo he did in all his Preaching. Indeed this Author was a ſon of thunder, and a ſon of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; he took all occaſions from the Texts he Preached upon, to thunder out the wrath of God againſt ſinners, to ſet them before Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſhew them the fiery Law, that they might be convinced of their loſt and undone condition in themſelves: and then endeavoured to bring them unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſhew them Jeſus the Mediator, and the blood of ſprinkling, that taketh away ſin. In his Preaching he ſhewed the
<pb facs="tcp:151103:5"/> people the flaming Sword, the curſe of the Law; ſhewed them that the avenger of blood was coming; and then told them of Chriſt as the City of refuge, and cryed to them to flee unto him: And indeed he is a right Preacher of the Goſpel, that can thus change his voice, and readily turn his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe upon all occaſions. The bleſſing of Heaven go along with theſe Sermons, that they may be for the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</p>

            <p>This is <hi>a great myſtery,</hi> which we ſhall not fully underſtand till we come to Heaven; when Chriſt is ſaid to be ſent of God, 'tis to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>primarily</hi> of him, as he is the Son of God, and ſo he is ſaid to <hi>come down from heaven,</hi> John 3.13. <hi>To deſcend,</hi> Eph. 4.9. But he being in that reſpect equal with God the Father, Eternal, Infinite, Immenſe, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as the Father is, it may be asked, How the Lord Jeſus is ſaid to be ſent of the Father?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Lord Jeſus may be ſaid to be ſent of the Father as Mediator, <hi>in reſpect of the Covenant of Redemption</hi> between the Father and him, for the ſalvation of the Elect; for though Chriſt as God is equal with the Father, yet with reference to the work of Redemption, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151103:7"/> is ſaid to be his Elected one, and Servant. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.1, <hi>Behold, my ſervant whom I uphold; mine Elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus may be ſaid to be ſent of the Father, <hi>in regard of his Incarnation,</hi> ſo Gal. 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> Now, brethren, upon this account, becauſe the Father prepared him a body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. He is ſaid to ſend him to redeem us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord Jeſus may be ſaid to be ſent of the Father, <hi>in regard of his commiſſion;</hi> him hath God the Father ſealed, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. Chriſt and no other is <hi>ordained of God, an high Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How doth it appear, that Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he that was ſent of God to be the Saviour, according to the Promiſe made unto the Fathers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>By the miracles he wrought. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> could ſay ſo much, <hi>John</hi> 3.2. ſays he, <hi>We know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do theſe miracles but he who is ſent of God.</hi> John 5.36, 37, <hi>I have a greater wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then that of John; for the works that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works bear witneſs of me.</hi> And ſo when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent unto Chriſt, to know whether he was the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Go and ſhew him the things which you do hear and ſee; the Blind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ſight, and the Lame walk, the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are cleanſed. 'Tis true, the Prophets and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151103:7"/> the Apoſtles wrought miracles, but not by their own power and holineſs: but Chriſt wrought them by his own power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By his raiſing of himſelf from the dead;</hi> As he is ſaid to be raiſed by the Father, ſo he is ſaid to be raiſed from his own power, <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 21, <hi>Deſtroy, ſaith he, this temple</hi> (ſpeaking of his Body) <hi>and I will raiſe it up in three days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe might be added many other demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as that all the Notes and Characters of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> were fulfilled and accompliſhed in him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, every believer hath the witneſs in himſelf, that Jeſus is the Son of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. Their faith is not a meer hiſtorical faith, or grounded upon what is commonly owned and profeſſed where they live; but the Spirit bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs to their hearts, that Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> is the Son of God, the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was to come into the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing is, to ſhew you <hi>wherefore God ſent his Son into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The great buſineſs</hi> that Chriſt was ſent into the world for, was <hi>to ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> to ſave them that were given to him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There were ſome particular perſons given to Chriſt by name, to be his people, to be his ſheep, that he ſhould take care of, to bring to eternal life. <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given me power over all fleſh, that I ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given me.</hi> 1 John 4.14. <hi>And we have ſeen, and do teſtifie,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151103:8"/> that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the world,</hi> that is, his Elect of the world of mankind: And ſo it was Propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. that he ſhould <hi>make an end of ſin, and make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> There was not one man in the world that was able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for his iniquity; Chriſt was ſent to do that. There was none righteous, no not one. Chriſt was ſent to bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, to make his people righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; Chriſt was ſent to fulfill the Law for his people, by his Active and Paſſive obedience: He came to do, and procure all that is required, to the compleat and perfect ſalvation of his people.</p>
            <p>In a word, Jeſus Chriſt was ſent into the World, not meerly as a Prophet, to teach the Mind and Will of God, or to be an example of holineſs; but he was ſent to be <hi>a Prieſt,</hi> in a proper ſenſe, to make atonement and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of his people, and to obtain eternal redemption for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 1. <hi>We may ſee here, that the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was a great work:</hi> Not the higheſt Angel of Heaven, nor all of them put together were able to perform this; but God ſent his Son about this work.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>We may ſee here, that the heart of God the Father was in this great work of redeeming
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151103:8"/> and ſaving the elect.</hi> The Father himſelf loved them, for he ſent his Son, he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that they might live through him.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. <hi>We may ſee here the love of Chriſt unto thoſe that the Father had given him,</hi> That he was willing to be their Mediator; for as he is often ſaid to be ſent of the Father, ſo he is ſaid to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Chriſt was ſo ſent, as that he came freely, came with alacrity and chearfulneſs; for his delight was with the Sons of men, his heart was in this work.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Let this encourage ſinners to come to Chriſt to venture their ſouls upon him.</hi> Do not queſtion whether God will accept of you by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers righteouſneſs, diſcharge you by a payment made by a Surety, deliver you from going down to the Pit upon a ranſom given by another; for all this was the contrivement of the Lord himſelf, to glorifie both his Juſtice, and his Mercy for ever. Therefore let ſinners caſt themſelves upon Chriſt and fear not, this Rock will never fail that Soul that is built upon it.</p>
            <p>I come now to the next words, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>ſpeaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That Jeſus Christ, our Mediator, hath the ſpirit given him by the Father without meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151103:9"/>
            <p>This is a great and glorious truth, and very ſweet and comfortable to the Saints, that the Lord Jeſus their Mediator hath a fulneſs of the ſpirit. Pſal. 45.7. <hi>Anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows.</hi> Chriſt hath the ſpirit above what any of the Saints have; and ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. Iſa. 2.11. <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſpirit of council and might, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of knowledg and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> And you have a viſible fulfilling of thoſe Prophecies, John 1.32. <hi>And John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the ſpirit deſcending from Heaven like a Dove, and it abode upon him.</hi> And ſo Acts 10.3. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed with the Devil, for God was with him.</hi> And in another place, <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> All fullneſs of the Spirit, all fullneſs of Grace dwells in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Three Things for the opening of this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is here meant by the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How the Spirit is ſaid to be given to Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing he is God.</hi> How can any gift be ſaid to be conferred upon him, ſeeing he is God, and infinite in himſelf?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How it may be ſaid, that the ſpirit is given unto him without meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is here meant by the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Gifts and Graces of the Spirit,</hi> theſe are given to Chriſt, not by meaſure, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151103:9"/>2. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf,</hi> Luke 4.14. <hi>And Jeſus returned in the power of the ſpirit full of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Believers have not only the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, but the Spirit it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:</hi> and the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwells in you, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And if the Spirit be in Believers, and dwells in them, much more in Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>How can Chriſt, who is God, and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and uncapable of addition, be ſaid to have the ſpirit given unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly in a word or two. It is true, that Jeſus Chriſt, as God, is infinite, and as God he is not capable of having the ſpirit given unto him; but the ſpirit was given unto Jeſus Chriſt as man, the ſpirit was given to his humane nature which he took upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>If the ſpirit was given to the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, how can the humane nature hold the fullneſs of the ſpirit? the humane nature is finite, how can it receive an infinite? how then is it ſaid, that God hath not given the ſpirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, The expreſſion in the Text is not to be underſtood without any limitation, as if the Spirit were given to the humane nature of Chriſt in an infinite manner, and as if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature were of an infinite capacity; the Divine nature of Chriſt is infinite, but though the Divine and humane nature in Chriſt are eternally united, yet they are not confounded.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151103:10"/> This then I ſay, that the ſpirit was given to the humane nature of Chriſt, beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, beyond all the Saints on Earth or in Heaven, and above all the Angels put them all together. The ſpirit is given to Chriſt as man incomparatively, and tranſcendently beyond what ever men or Angels have had, or ſhall have. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him all fullneſs ſhould dwell;</hi> which cannot be ſaid of any other.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>It is ſaid, that Jeſus increaſed in wiſdom, and ſtature, and in favour with God and man,</hi> Luk. 2.52. <hi>How had he ſuch a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit, and yet is ſaid to increaſe in Wiſdom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, The Word being made Fleſh, he was full of Grace, full of the Spirit from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry birth; but he is ſaid to increaſe in Wiſdom, in reſpect of the effects and opperations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and declarations of his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>One Queſtion more, <hi>How comes it to be ſo, that the Lord Jeſus is ſo filled with the ſpirit in his humane nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer 1. <hi>One reaſon is taken from the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his humane nature to the Divine.</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son of God, he hath the very eſſence of God, the nature of God, and the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt is brought very near to the God-head: It is brought as near as our Bodies to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151103:10"/> our Souls, and therefore it is ſaid, that in him dwells the fullneſs of the Godhead bodily, that is perſonally. The Sun is the Fountain of light, and the nearer we come to the Sun, the more we partake of light; ſo the humane nature of Chriſt being brought ſo near to the God-head, as to be taken into perſonal union with the God-head, the humane nature partakes of Grace and Gifts to its utmoſt capacity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be filled with the ſpirit in our nature, that ſo he might be able to manage his work and office,</hi> to perform his active and paſſive obedience, and to be a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe and treaſury of grace and conſolation to his people, that they may be ſupplied from him, and of his fullneſs receive, and grace for grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Learn whence it is that a perſon may be enabled to ſpeak holily and graciouſly: It is ſaid here, that Chriſt ſpake the words of God, and he brings in this for a reaſon, for he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the ſpirit by meaſure.</hi> The more we have of the Spirit of God, the more we ſhall ſpeak the Words of God; and though we can never have ſo much of the ſpirit as Jeſus Chriſt had, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>peak the Words of God. What is the reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat our words are no more ſavory and ſpiritual, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151103:11"/> have the ſpirit at all in a ſanctifying way. And for thoſe whoſe words are altogether carnal and vain, nothing but prophane, ſcurrilous, unclean ſpeeches come from them; ſuch may well think that they have not the Spirit of God. He that hath the Spirit of God, will endeavour in ſome meaſure to ſpeak the Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of God; for where the Spirit of God is given in a ſaving manner, he ſanctifies the heart, and ſanctifies the tongue, and ſo cauſes their words to be gracious and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in ſome meaſure. Therefore as we deſire that our ſpeech may be with grace, holy and edifying, pray for the ſpirit to be given unto us. It is ſaid of Chriſt, that they wondered at the gracious words that proceeded from him; he was full of the ſpirit, and he ſpake the words of God. O let us be much in prayer for the ſpirit, to give us a mouth, and wiſdom upon all occaſions; pray that we may have the ſpirit to fill our hearts with holy thoughts, and to fill our mouths with holy diſcourſe.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151103:13"/> to all Believers, and he that hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt is none of his, not yet of his called ones; The Believer is called the Spiritual man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. Some may pretend to be made partakers of Chriſt, and yet be miſtaken; but he that ſhall mock people, and uſe it as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to them, that they believe in Chriſt, and are Chriſtians, is a Blaſphemer; And ſo is he that ſhall uſe it as a Reproach to any, That this is one that hath the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now I come to verſ. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words ſeem to hold forth the Reaſon of the former; he had ſaid before, that God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him, that is, Chriſt. And why ſo? <hi>For the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father loves the Elect Angels, and loves Elect men; but the Father loves the Son above all others. There is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the words, <hi>The Father loveth the Son;</hi> that is, He loves him moſt eminently, tranſcendently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hath given all things into his hand.]</hi> He hath made him the great Commander and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World.</p>
            <p>By <hi>the Son,</hi> here we are not to underſtand Chriſt as God, as the Second Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but as God-man, Mediator. Indeed the Father loved the Son, as he was God equal with him, of the ſame Subſtance and Eternity: But when it is ſaid, that the Father hath given all things into his hand, we muſt underſtand it of Chriſt, as God-man, Mediator: For conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151103:14"/> Chriſt as God, he had all things in his hand, as the Father had; but it is as he is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mediator, that the Father hath put all things into his hand.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is beloved of the Father above all Creatures, above Men or Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be ſome may think there is no great matter in this point; but truly it is of great concernment to us, that we may more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently look to Chriſt for our acceptance with God through him. Mat. 3.17. <hi>This is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. Paul</hi> ſpeaking of him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. ſaith, that God <hi>hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> Others are beloved, but Chriſt is the Beloved. And again, Coloſ. 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Chriſt himſelf often makes mention of the Fathers love to him, Joh. 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> Joh. 15.9. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I, loved you.</hi> Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father, I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me; for thou lovedſt me before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi> 'Tis ſaid indeed, verſ. 23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; that the world may know, that thou haſt ſent me; and that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi> It is true, the Father loves the Elect people as really and truely as he loveth Chriſt; but he doth not love them ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151103:14"/> abundantly, not in the ſame degree; neither can they be loved with that kind of Love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, that the Father loveth the Son, as will appear in the opening of the Point.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Let us enquire wherein the Love of the Father towards Chriſt doth tranſcend and exceed his Love to all other Creatures, Men or Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Father loveth Chriſt, as he is the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of the ſame Divine Eſſence with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Believers are the Sons of God by Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but Chriſt is the Son of God by an Eternal and Unutterable Generation: Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Therefore muſt the Father needs love Chriſt above Men or Angels, becauſe he is the only begotten Son; and though they be two diſtinct Perſons, and ſo they are ſpoken of in the Text, <hi>the Father and the Son,</hi> yet they are one Eſſence. And though the Son hath now taken upon him our Nature, yet he is God ſtill, and ſo continues for ever, and is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate, and every way fit object of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Love, in the higheſt degree, to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Father loveth Chriſt above all other creatures, Men or Angels, upon the account of his being the Redeemer and Saviour of the Elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom he hath given him to bring to Glory.</hi> The glory of God's Grace, Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is made known in ſuch a wonderful manner by the Lord Jeſus as Mediator, that the Father loves him upon that account; Joh. 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I lay down my Life.</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151103:15"/> have I received of my Father.</hi> That the Son conſented to be Mediator, and to take upon him the Nature of man, and to dye and ſuffer, to ſatisfie Juſtice for Sin, this is highly pleaſing to the Father; Heb. 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me; in Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices for Sin thou haſt had no pleaſure. Then ſaid, Lo I come (in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me) to do thy Will O God.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth Chriſt, not only as his Eternal Son, but as he condeſcended to be Mediator for his People, Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of men; and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath alſo highly exalted him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Father delights in Chriſt, not only as he is the Eternal Son, but as he is his Elected one, Elected to be the Head and Saviour of his Body the Church.</hi> Iſai. 42.1. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles.</hi> That the Son took upon him the form of a Servant, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God might be made manifeſt in him, and that he ſhould bring back and lead the Elect people to God, makes the Father to love him, and delight in him as Mediator. He freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151103:15"/> the work, and has faithfully diſcharged it, Joh. 17.4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us enquire wherein the Father hath ſhewn and expreſſed ſuch a great and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Love to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Father had an unſpeakable complacency and delight in Chriſt from Eternity, and that not only as his Eternal Son, and God equal with him; but as he had conſented &amp; agreed to be Mediator for them whom he had appointed to be Heirs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Prov. 8.23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29. <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, before ever the Earth was. —Then was I by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is the moſt intimate Fellowſhip and Communion between the Father and him, in all that the Father doth.</hi> As to the works of Creation, <hi>All things were created by him and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16. <hi>All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> Joh. 1.3. And as to the work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was the great Inſtrument of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; tis ſaid, <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>That in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth, even in him,</hi> Epheſ. 1.10.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:151103:16"/>3. <hi>The Father hath ſhewn all the Benevolence or Beneficence to Chriſt, as Mediator, as poſſibly could be.</hi> He hath filled him with the Spirit in our Nature, as full as the Humane Nature can hold; and as he is God manifeſt in the Fleſh hath given all into his hand, and hath put ſuch honour upon him as Mediator, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his People ask in his Name, it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; and when he comes at the laſt Day to judge the World in our humane Nature, he ſhall come in all the Glory of the Father, with all his holy Angels.</p>

Seeing the Father loveth the Son in ſuch a wonderful manner, <hi>Then wo be to thoſe that hate him.</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi> If any man love him not as he is the Son of God, if any man love him not as Mediator, if any man hearing this Jeſus preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, doth not approve of this way of Salvation by Chriſt, and doth deliberately reject him and put him away, let him be curſed till the Lord come; let him ſtill remain under the curſe of the Law, and let him be curſed when the Lord cometh; let him be put amongſt thoſe to whom Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fear there may be ſome amongſt us, that will be found haters of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If your hearts continue to riſe againſt the way of Salvation by Chriſt, you will be found ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of him. If you love your ſins, and hold them faſt, and will not have Chriſt to reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, then you will be found haters of Chriſt: If you hate the Diſciples of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Image and Grace in them, then you will be found haters of Chriſt. But if you believe in him, and your hearts cleave unto him, and you are troubled that you love him no more, that he is no more precious to you, then go in peace.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:151103:18"/>
            <p>Uſe 4. <hi>Seeing the Father loveth the Son in ſuch a wonderful manner, let this ſtir us up to love Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us love him as God, and love him him as God-man, Mediator: You ſee he is an object fit for the Love of God the Father, and then he is an object worthy of our love. And as God the Father loves him with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Love, ſo let us do likewiſe. Read what Chriſt ſaith, Joh. 14.21. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> And ſee verſe 23. You will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looſe any thing by loving Jeſus Chriſt. Epheſ. 6.24. <hi>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>And hath put all things into his hand.]</hi> Before I come to raiſe the Doctrine from theſe words, let me briefly ſhew you the meaning of this expreſſion. <hi>And hath put all things into his hand.</hi> The meaning is, that he hath put all Power and Authority into his hand, he hath made him Supreme Head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over all things; the Father hath made him Ruler and Diſpoſer of all; the great King, Lord and Potentate over all.</p>
            <p>And further, take notice, that this is ſpoken of Jeſus as God-man, Mediator; Chriſt is made the Lord of Heaven and Earth in our Nature. As Chriſt is the Son of God, ſo he is equal with the Father; ſo it cannot be properly ſaid, that the Father hath given all things into his hand; for he had all things originally in his hand as God, but as God-man, Mediator, ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151103:19"/> the Father hath given all things into his hand, that now in our nature, in our fleſh, he is the great Potentate of the world, and hath all things committed to him of the Father.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That God the Father hath given unto Jeſus Chriſt in our Nature, full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all things, both in Heaven and in Earth, he hath put all things into his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Point of great Concernment, and for the great comfort and eſtabliſhing of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in evil times, that all things are given into the hand of our great Mediator. You ſee <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> here gives a full teſtimony to this truth; will you hear what Chriſt ſaith in his own perſon, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> Mat. 11.27. And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, <hi>All Power is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> Joh. 13.3. <hi>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hand</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew you how all things are put into the hand of Chriſt,</hi> given into his hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All men are given into Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>hand.</hi> But here we muſt diſtinguiſh, There are ſome given to Chriſt in a ſpecial manner, and for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation: There are ſome given to Chriſt to that very end and purpoſe, that he ſhould give them Eternal Life. Joh. 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal Life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> You ſee that ſome are ſo given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts hand, that he by his Office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator is engaged and hath undertaken to give
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151103:19"/> them Eternal Life. <hi>Other ſheep I have which are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice,</hi> Joh. 10.16. Chriſt there calls them whom the Father hath given him in the Covenant of Redemption, his ſheep, though they are not yet converted, and ſaith, he muſt bring them in, and they ſhall hear his voice. Joh. 17. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me, for they are thine;</hi> and yet he prayed as Mediator, not only for them that were then Believers and converted, but for them that ſhould afterwards believe unto everlaſting Life. Verſ. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi> Verſ. 24. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The reſt of men are put into Chriſts hand, even thoſe that periſh; ſo as that Chriſt hath full power to over-rule them and their actings; ſo as that they ſhall not quite root out his Church, ſo as that he ſhall have Glory in carrying on his work, ſo far as he pleaſes, against all their oppoſition; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them ſo far as he thinks fit in this Life, and paſs ſentence of everlaſting Damnation againſt them at the Laſt Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee all men are given into Chriſt's hand, Elect and non-Elect; the Elect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem and ſave, and the reſt to order them and diſpoſe of them as he pleaſes in this World, a d to judge them at the Laſt Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All the Angels are given into Chriſts hands.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151103:20"/> The Elect Angels are given into his hand to confirm them, as ſome think, and to make uſe of them in his Mediatory Kingdom, as he pleaſes. The fallen Angels are given into his hand, ſo as that he hath Power to check them and reſtrain them, and ſet bounds to them, that they ſhall not Devour and Prevail againſt any of his redeemed People; and likewiſe to ſit in Judgment upon them, and paſs open Sentence of Condemnation upon them at the Laſt Day. Epheſ. 1.21, 22. 'Tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he is far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come: And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be Head over all things to the Church.</hi> Luk. 10.17. <hi>And the ſeventy returned with joy, ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject to us through thy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>All Creatures, whether animate or inanimate,</hi> are given into the hand of Chriſt as Mediator, God-man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All animate Creatures, all rational Creatures.</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10. <hi>Wherefore alſo God hath highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name; That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven and things on Earth</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All inanimate, all irrational Creatures.</hi> Pſal. 8.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>For thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, (viz.</hi> barely conſidered as man, though far above all the Angels, as God-man; Mediator) <hi>and haſt crowned him with Glory and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151103:20"/> Honour. Thou madeſt him to have dominion over the works of thy hand; thou haſt put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, all ſheep and oxen, yea, and the beaſts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fiſh of the Sea.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>All things that do concern the ordering of the Churches here in this world, are given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Chriſt as Mediator.</hi> What Officers ſhall be in his Churches, what Diſcipline, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Cenſures, Ordinances and Worſhip, theſe things are not left to mens Inventions, but all muſt be ordered as Chriſt hath appointed in the Word, Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things that I have commanded.</hi> The very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were limited, that they ſhould teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be obſerved in Spiritual matters, but what Chriſt commanded, and then much more all Church-Guides in theſe days; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given the Power of making Laws and Orders for his Church into Chriſts hand only. No Power on Earth can add or take away from the Sacraments, Cenſures, Officers and Ordinances that Chriſt hath appointed; for the Father hath given all things into his hand.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>All Providential Diſpenſations in this world are given into the hand of Chriſt;</hi> all publick and private concernments; <hi>Thou haſt given him Power over all fleſh,</hi> Joh. 17.2. <hi>For the Father
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151103:21"/> judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. We muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, as if God the Father had ſo put things into the hand of Chriſt, as if he had not Power and Authority ſtill over all; but the meaning is, that he hath given the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all into Chriſt's hand, as Mediator, by way of Honour and Truſt, to order all for the Glory of God, and for the Eternal Salvation of thoſe, whom he hath given him to be his Myſtical Body.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the Second thing, to ſhew you, <hi>Why, or to what end the Father hath given all things into Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>hands as Mediator:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Father hath done this for his own Glory.</hi> Phil. 2.11, 12. <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name, —That every tongue ſhould confeſs that Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> 'Tis for the Glory of God the Father, that he hath laid help upon ſuch a mighty One, and ſet ſuch a King upon his holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Father hath done this for the Glory of Chriſt too: That all men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.32. <hi>Wherefore when he brings in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Father hath done it for the Churches ſake too; for the Elects ſake he hath given him to be the head over all things to the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22. to order all things for the accompliſhing and perfecting their Salvation; and to that end he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151103:21"/> hath the heart of man amongſt other things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into his hand, that Chriſt hath power as Mediator, to make his people willing to cloſe with him. Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Joh. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me.</hi> Joh. 12.32. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Application.</p>
            <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Seeing the Father hath given all things into Chriſt's hand, then let us all come to Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, believe in him:</hi> And this is the very Uſe that Chriſt himſelf makes of this point. Mat. 11.27, 28. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: And no man knoweth the Son but the Father: Neither knoweth any man the Father, but the Son, and he to whomſoever he will reveal him. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Seeing the Father hath given all into Chriſt's hand, come unto him for whatſoever you want, come to him for Pardon, for Righteouſneſs, for peace of Conſcience, for Knowledg, for Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for all. Joh. 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſhes, but for that meat which endureth to everlaſting Life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> He hath Authority and Commiſſion from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all things are given into his hand. Him hath God the Father ſealed, therefore come unto him, that you may have the meat that endureth to everlaſting Life; He hath the keys
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151103:22"/> of Hell and of Death, He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, He is able to reſcue you from the very jaws of Hell; therefore, I ſay, venture your Souls upon him. The Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to be Prophet, Prieſt and King; come therefore unto him for all that you ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Seeing the Father hath given all into Chriſts hand, let all ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be Angry, and ye periſh from the way.</hi> We are all to do Homage to Chriſt, to be ſubject to Chriſt; and this is called a Kiſſing of the Son. You read of thoſe that did not bow the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor kiſſed him; It is ſpoken of the People of God that would not owne <hi>Baal:</hi> and the Idolaters that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sun and the Moon, becauſe they could not reach them to kiſs them, therefore they kiſſed their hand, in token of Homage and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them, as is implyed in <hi>Job</hi>'s words, Chap. 31.26, 27. So that this is one thing that is intended by this Phraſe, of Kiſſing the Son, that we ſhould do Homage unto him and be Subject unto him. Therefore ſeeing all is given into Chriſts hand, and he ſhall Judge the Quick and the Dead at his appearing and his Kingdom, give dilligence that you may be found of him in Peace, that you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in him as a Saviour, and accepted of him as a Judge; for we muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But may ſome ſay, When we conſider what a great Lord, Jeſus Chriſt is, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151103:22"/> hath made him the Judge of all, and that he ſhall come in all the Glory of the Father, with all his holy Angels, and all muſt appear before his Judgment-Seat, to give an account, the thoughts of Chriſt begin to be terrible to us ſinful, guilty creatures; we begin to ſay in our hearts, <hi>How ſhall we be able to ſtand before this great Lord and Judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. <hi>Chriſt is a Prieſt as well as a King, a Saviour as well as a Judge;</hi> So that if you put your truſt in him as a Mediator, and be found in his Righteouſneſs, then you may be able to ſtand before him, elſe not. Therefore labour to know Chriſt <hi>in his Prieſtly Office,</hi> and believe in him, that you may be waſhed and made white in his Blood, and that he may be the Lord your Righteouſneſs; then you may have boldneſs to ſtand before him, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and confounded at his coming. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, now come to him as a Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom at laſt you muſt come as a Judge.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. <hi>Seeing all things are given into Chriſt's hand, let not Believers fear theſe black ſtorms of Perſecution that may come upon them in this world.</hi> The ſame Jeſus that ſhed his Blood for his People, he hath the ordering, over-ruling, and diſpoſing of all things: Know that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come upon you, but it muſt paſs through the hand of Chriſt, therefore fear not: Not only men, but Devils alſo are ſubject to his Power; yea, he hath Power over our Luſts and Corruptions, therefore they ſhall not have dominion over us. And in the worſt times,

            <p>Object. <hi>But if the ordering of all things is given into Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>hand, it ſeems ſtrange, that he ſuffers many times his Enemies to be the chief in Power, and his People to be low and perſecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. <hi>Chriſt ſuffers it, yea, orders it ſo, that he may have the greater Glory in carrying on his work againſt ſo much oppoſition.</hi> The Goſpel never prevailed more in the world, than when the Rulers were Heathens and Perſecutors: and Chriſt hath Glory too, in puniſhing his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies here and hereafter. And as for the People of God, they are the more Spiritual, and Heavenly, and Courageous in times of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Uſe 4. <hi>Seeing all things are given into Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>hand, this may aſſure us of the perſeverance of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> What ſhould hinder it? Chriſt is above Satan, above the corruption of their hearts; and ſeeing the Father hath given them to him, he will keep them unto the end. Joh. 17.12. <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, ſave the Son of Perdition.</hi> And as for <hi>Judas,</hi> called here the Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he never was a Believer in the ſenſe that the reſt were, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.64. but <hi>a Devil,</hi> verſ. 70. Though <hi>Judas</hi> was given to Chriſt to be an Apoſtle for a time, and given into Chriſts hand, as the very Devils are, ſo as that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151103:24"/> he ſhall puniſh them for ever; yet <hi>Judas</hi> was never ſo given to Chriſt to redeem, to ſave, to bring to Glory, to be a Member of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body: For thoſe that are ſo given to Chriſt, not one of them can be loſt, ſeeing Chriſt hath taken the charge of their Salvation, and wants neither Wiſdom, nor Faithfulneſs, nor Love, nor Power, to bring them ſafe to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now I come to verſ. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life: And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you have the Concluſion of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sermon, or Speech of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> He had ſet forth Chriſt's Glory and Excellency as the Churches Bridegroom, verſ. 29. <hi>He that hath the Bride, is the Bridegroom: but the friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly, becauſe of the Bridegrooms voice: This my joy therefore is fulfilled.</hi> He had ſhewn, how he muſt increaſe and be glorious in the eyes of all; that he came from above, from Heaven, and is above all; that the Father ſent him, and gave him the Spirit above meaſure; that the Father loved him, and hath given all things into hand.</p>
            <p>And now he comes to make the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of this, <hi>That men would believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> This Duty of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151103:25"/> on Chriſt, is preſſed by two ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Motives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Argument is taken from the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that comes by believing on Chriſt.</hi> [He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.] This is a great benefit indeed, Life is very deſirable, eſpecialy everlaſting Life; yea, for further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believe in Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>That he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life;</hi> Not only that he ſhall have it, but he hath it already; he hath everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Argument is taken from the contrary;</hi> namely, <hi>The great Danger, the great Evil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that will be the portion of all thoſe that do not believe the Son.</hi> And this is ſet out, not only <hi>Privatively,</hi> he ſhall not ſee Life; but <hi>Poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as an addition to that miſery, The wrath of God abideth on them.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That he that believes on Chriſt the Son of God, hath everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That he that believeth not the Son, that believeth not in the Lord Jeſus, ſhall not ſee Life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That whoſoever believeth on Chriſt the Son of God hath everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is much ſpoken of, That he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son, is delivered from the wrath to come: Joh. 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:151103:25"/> Joh. 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, ſhould have everlaſting Life.</hi> And verſ. 47. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlaſting Life.</hi> He ſpeaks it with an Aſſeveration, Verily, verily, he that believeth on me hath everlaſting Life. Joh. 20.31. <hi>But theſe things are written, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have Life through his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us enquire, <hi>what is meant by this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life,</hi> that is, the Portion of every one that believeth in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What is this believing,</hi> this Faith, upon which a Man or Woman comes to have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To give you <hi>ſome Demonſtrations, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to prove that he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life;</hi> Becauſe poſſibly ſome may Queſtion it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Shew you <hi>in what Senſe he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life already;</hi> for the Text ſaith, ſuch an one hath everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us enquire <hi>what is meant by this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life,</hi> which is the Portion of every be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieving Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By everlaſting Life, here we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Life that conſiſts in the Union of Body and Soul:</hi> No, Brethren, though our Bodies and Souls ſhould be everlaſtingly united, and never be ſeperated by Death, yet that is not the everlaſting Life here ſpoken of; yea, and the Damned at the Reſurrection ſhall have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151103:26"/> their Bodies and Souls united together, and ſhall ſo continue to Eternity, and yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee this everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>This everlaſting Life in the Text is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hapineſs that we are capable of; It conſiſts in Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Freedom from all ſin and from all evils whatſoever,</hi> called, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. The obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The enjoyment of all that is Perfectly Good. Grace and Glory,</hi> Pſal. 84.11. this ſtate is called the <hi>better Country,</hi> even <hi>an Heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11.16. God is the Believers God, and he hath prepared for them a City; and in enjoying God they enjoy all.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>obſerve, that the Happineſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is for ever;</hi> they are not freed from all evil for a time only, and enjoy all good for a time only; but for ever: And ſo they have everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us enquire <hi>what is this believing,</hi> what this Faith is, upon which a man or woman comes to have everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>'Tis not a bare aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel; 'Tis not a meer Hiſtorical Faith: Yea, though</hi> you ſhould be ſomewhat affected with it, and hear the Word with Joy, and do many things as <hi>Herod</hi> did.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>believing, is a Receiving of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome word of Grace, wherby the humbled Sinner doth wholy rely upon Jeſus Chriſt for Life and Salvation.</hi> Although we are to believe all that is Written in the Law and the Prophets,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151103:26"/> and the whole Word of God; yet <hi>Chriſt as a Saviour and Mediator is the object of juſtifying Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> Faith is wrought in us by the hearing of the Goſpel, by ſome word of Grace wherein Chriſt is held forth as a Saviour, either Explicitly or Implicitly. The Text ſaith, <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> bids the Jaylor, <hi>believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> So that whatſoever word the Lord hints to us, to work and beget Faith in our Hearts, yet the Soul doth not ſtay there, but Ventures and Caſts it ſelf wholy upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>as the Saviour and Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To give you ſome <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> or Arguments, to prove, that whoſoever believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God the Father promiſed this to Chriſt the Mediator, in the behalf of his Ranſomed ones:</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie promiſed before the world began.</hi> God promiſed to Chriſt no leſs than Eternal Life for his Seed. Rom. 6. laſt, <hi>The Gift of God is Eternal Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.25. <hi>This is the Promiſe which he hath promiſed us, even eternal Life.</hi> This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Chriſt, that by his Obedience all his People ſhould be made Righteous, and have Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt, as Mediator, prayed for no leſs than Eternal Life for his people,</hi> and the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heareth him. Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father, I will,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151103:27"/> that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me</hi>—</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed Eternal Life for his People:</hi> Hebr. 9.15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of Death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called, might receive the Promiſe of Eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> Chriſt having made Satisfaction for the Sins of his People, and brought in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs for them, What ſhould now hinder them of Everlaſting Life, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his Name.</p>
            <p n="4">4. One thing more, to ſhew you in what ſenſe it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>That he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life;</hi> not only ſhall have it, but hath Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>Seeing that Believers have Sin dwelling and remaining in them, and are liable to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Buffetings of Satan, and liable to all kind of outward Sorrows and Afflictions, and have this Earthly Tabernacle yet to put off; How can it be ſaid, that a Believer now hath everlaſting Life?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. <hi>In regard of the certainty of it.</hi> As when it is ſaid <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen; 'Tis as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, as if it were fallen already: So it is as certain, that Believers ſhall have everlaſting Life, as if they had it already. And ſo it is ſaid, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us.</hi> We are ſaved already.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:151103:27"/>2. <hi>In regard that everlaſting Life is begun to a Believer:</hi> Every Believer is in a juſtified eſtate, his Sins pardoned, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him, and Holineſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is begun already in this Life; his Fellowſhip is now with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of Christ our head;</hi> Epheſ. 2.6, <hi>He hath raiſed us up, and made us ſit together in Heavenly Places in Christ.</hi> The members of the myſtical Body are now in Heaven, though not in their own Perſons, yet in Chriſt their Head, Heb. 6.20. <hi>Whither the fore-runner is for us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, even Jeſus;</hi> He hath taken up Heaven for them, and appears in the preſence of God for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. From what is ſaid here, That he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life; and he that beleiveth not on the Son, ſhall not ſee Life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. <hi>Learn that there is an everlaſting eſtate appointed for every one, either everlaſting Life, or everlaſting Death. An eternity there is for every one of us, and we are near it, we are upon the brink of it,</hi> we are near Heaven or Hell. The Lord knows that we mind theſe preſent things too much, and eternity very little: But, O! That when we come to dye, to go into eternity, that we may be in Chriſt; that ſo when the Earthly houſe of this Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we may have a Building of God, an Houſe not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151103:28"/> made with hands Eternal in the Heavens. O! that we may remember our eternal condition more, that the thoughts of Eternity may be with us in our Callings and Buſineſs all the day long; and that we may make ſure of our intereſt of Chriſt, that we may have everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Wonder at the Lord's Grace in Chriſt, that he ſhould give everlaſting Life to any of us, fallen, ſinful men.</hi> God doth not give everlaſting Life to any of the Angels that ſinned; but caſt them all down to Hell. And you that live under the Preaching of the Goſpel, bleſs God that you hear of theſe glad tidings of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life through Chriſt; and hearing this way of Life Preached and Declared to you, O! that you may receive Chriſt, That you may believe on him, that you may have everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. <hi>Heere is matter of ſtrong conſolation to thoſe that have believed on the Son; O! Let ſuch rejoyce in the Grace of God,</hi> the Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded towards them in his kindneſs through Chriſt Jeſus; It is true, you may meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrows here in this world, but rejoyce in this, that there is no Condemnation to you; becauſe you are in Chriſt Jeſus: And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Condemnation, but you have everlaſting Life. You may loſe Eſtate, Name, Liberty, and Life in this World, but you can never loſe everlaſting Life: for he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:151103:28"/>
            <p>Uſe 4. <hi>Here is Direction to thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their ſins, that are weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whoſe conſciences are preſſed with the burden of their ſins, as if they had a heavy mountain lay upon them; O! Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World; believe on the Lord Jeſus, and you ſhall be ſaved and have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> You know not what to do, but O flee to Chriſt for help, he came into the World to ſave ſinners, and he is able to ſave all that come unto God by him, whatſoever their guilt, whatſoever their ſins are.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument, or motive to believe in Chriſt, is taken, from the Miſery, and loſt Eſtate and Condition of thoſe who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt. <hi>He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that beliveth not the Son,</hi> that is, he that believeth not on the Son; this is Spoken in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former part of the Verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhall not ſee Life.]</hi> 'Tis a Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; the meaning is, he ſhall not enjoy everlaſting Life, he ſhall not enter into it, he hath no part in eternal Life: yea, and for the preſent, <hi>the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> as to the State and Condition wherin he is.</p>
            <p>Some take theſe words to be intended, of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151103:29"/> thoſe only; who never to the laſt, believe in Chriſt, that ſuch ſhall not ſee Life, <hi>but the wrath of God abideth on them.</hi> This is true, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith even of the Elect, that they <hi>are by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. We may take the words ſo, that all whatſoever, whilſt unbelievers, ſhall not ſee Life, <hi>but the wrath of God abideth on them.</hi> The Elect, though they are given to Chriſt from Eternity, yet they are neither juſtified nor Sanctified till they do believe in Chriſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Lord hath thoughts of Peace to them, which ſhall be manifeſted in due time; but they having ſinned as well as others, they are under the Curſe of the Law as well as others, until they do believe on Chriſt; yet ſo, as that they ſhall not any one of them have the Sentence of Condemnation Executed upon them, but ſhall be delivered from going down to the Pit; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath ſound a Ranſom for them. The Decree of Election ſhall be executed upon them, and the Redemption of Chriſt ſhall be applied to them, to prevent the fall and final Execution of the Curſe of the Law, in their Eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe who never believe one the Son, the Curſe of the Law comes Fully and Eternally upon them, <hi>and ſo the Wrath of God abideth on them for ever.</hi> All have ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo are become guilty before God; All have an inward Rebellion and Oppoſition in their Nature againſt God: All when they come to underſtanding are Guilty of Actual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151103:29"/> ſin: So that it cannot be, that ever we ſhould ſee Life, but ſhould have the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide upon us, except we be juſtified freely by Grace, through the Redemption which is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord; and we receive this Grace by believing on Chriſt, <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation for ſins, through Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. It is by Faith, that we receive the attonement that Chriſt hath made for our ſins, and the everlaſting Righteouſneſs that he hath performed for us.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Wrath of God which the Text ſpeaks of, you muſt not underſtand it as if there were ſuch Paſſions in God as there are in man: but the Scripture ſpeaks of things to our weak capacities. God's Wrath is his afflicting and puniſhing, 'tis his revenging Juſtice, and this all men are liable unto for their ſins, who do not believe on the Name of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Learn hence, that it is not incongruous or diſagreeing to the Praching of the Goſpel, to hold forth threatnings of Wrath.</hi> Here <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Evangellical diſcourſe of Chriſt, doth hold forth moſt terrible threatnings unto thoſe, that continue in the ſtate of Unbelief; he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on them.</hi> And ſo our Saviour, when he ſent out the Apoſtles to Preach unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſaith he, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be Damned,</hi> Mark. 16.16. Threatnings are a means appointed to awaken us to ſee our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and are uſeful in the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151103:30"/> Hebr. 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Hebr. 12.25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> Therefore both the Terrors of the Law, and the Threatnings for refuſing Chriſt the Mediator, are to be ſet home upon the Conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Learn hence what cauſe they have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and praiſe the Lord, who have been drawn to Chriſt, to know him and believe in him.</hi> Such are not only delivered from the wrath to come, but they ſhall ſee Life, they ſhall enjoy everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>And though Believers have the Death of the Body to encounter with, yet they need not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed; they may ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 15.55. <hi>O! Death, where is thy ſting? O! Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> He triumphs over Death, as if it were a poor unarmed Captive, Where is thy power and ſtrength? And as to Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although Believers may have much of the Croſs, yet they have nothing of the Curſe: <hi>Chriſt hath delivered us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>And we know that all things ſhall work for good to them that love God, who are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
            <p>You that are Believers in Chriſt, you may have free acceſs to God through him; you may ask for your ſelves, you may ask for your
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151103:30"/> Children, that they might live before him; you may ask for the Nation, you may ask for your Friends: Though you be unworthy in your ſelves, yet coming in his Name, and as thoſe that are in him, whatſoever you ask according to the Will of God, he heareth you: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all your Mercies and Priviledges here, when your days are expired, you ſhall have the full enjoyment of Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Seeing he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him: <hi>This ſhould put us all upon this great work of believing on Chriſt.</hi> This ſeems to be the very ſcope of this holy man <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in what he had ſaid here; he would have thoſe that he ſpake unto, to believe on Jeſus Chriſt: He ſhews them it is a matter of great concernment, a matter of Life and Death. Be you perſwaded of it, that this is a truth that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> here ſpeaks, <hi>That he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And O! Do you think that you are able to grapple with the wrath of God? Can you endure to have the wrath of God to abide upon you?</p>
            <p>Let me beſeech one thing of you, even for the Lord's ſake and for your own Souls ſake, that when you come home, that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire a little, get alone and ſeriouſly ponder theſe words, <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Ask
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151103:31"/> your own hearts, whether you believe what is ſpoken here, and that it ſhall be fulfilled upon all thoſe that reject Chriſt? And when you are alone, put it upon your hearts to conſider ſeriouſly, what it is to have the wrath of God abide upon you; what a miſerable condition that will be.</p>
            <p>If you had but a Sentence of Death paſſed upon you by a Judge of Aſſize, how terrible is it to moſt men! But then, how dreadful will this be to you, when the Lord ſhall ſay, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye Curſed? when the Lord ſhall ſay, that you ſhall never ſee Life, but the wrath of God ſhall abide on you for ever?</p>
            <p>Did you never ſee one under a deep ſenſe and apprehenſion of Gods wrath? O how ſuch an one will cry out! And yet it is but ſome drop, or ſo, that falls upon the Conſcience here in this Life, in compariſon of Hell. If you have not ſeen any under the ſenſe of God's wrath, conſider what the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> what Terrours they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and read the Story of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> there you may ſee what amazing, aſtoniſhing Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Wiſhes came from him, under a ſenſe of God's wrath lying upon him; he was ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that but he was watched by his Friends, and could not get opportunity, he would have killed himſelf.</p>
            <p>Yea, and conſider our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who never had any ſin inherent in him; yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the room of his People, and having
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151103:31"/> their ſins imputed to him, that by his Suffering in their ſtead, Juſtice might be ſatisfied for Sin; How he was filled with Aſtoniſhment and Grief under the wrath of God due to our ſins, Mat. 26.38. <hi>Then ſaith he unto them, My Soul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> Luk. 22.44. <hi>And being in an Agony he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground.</hi> And he cried out upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> We muſt not think that the Captain of our Salvation was thus ſorrowful, and ſweat drops of Blood, and cried out ſo vehemently for the fear and pain of bodily death, which many Martyrs and other men have endured without any great diſturbance; but Chriſt bare that in his Sufferings, that was ten Thouſand times more dreadful; he had the Iniquities of all his people at once laid upon him, and ſo bare the wrath of God due unto them. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mighty One, being God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſoon made Satisfaction for the ſins of his people, and ſo was acquitted and diſcharged, and is now in the ſame Nature wherein he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, at the right hand of God. But I pray conſider, If we bear the wrath of God our ſelves, what ſhall we do? You ſee it is no light matter, it will be a burden too heavy for us to bear, it will make us wiſh again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that we had never been born. And truely, if we do not believe on the Son, who hath born wrath for Sinners, and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone delivers from the wrath to come, it muſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151103:32"/> abide upon us. Think of theſe things between the Lord and your own Souls, and let us call to one another, and awaken one another, and tell one another of the danger that we are in. If this houſe where we are were ſet on fire, and one were aſleep here, it were time to awaken them. O! If you have Children, Servants, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that are in an ignorant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane way, call to them and endeavour to convince them of their ſins, and draw them to believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But it may be, ſome will ſay, you preſs this believing in Chriſt very much, and what is there in believing, that thoſe that believe ſhould have Everlaſting Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is nothing of Merit of Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Cauſality in our believing, to free us from the wrath of God, and to bring us to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Life. For everlaſting Life is the Gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; ſo that we do not ſet up Faith to have any part with Chriſt in the Glory of our Salvation. But I pray conſider it, that Faith is that Grace, whereby we loſt Sinners, being convinced of our Sins, and having no hope of any help and relief in our ſelves, do wholy betake our ſelves to Jeſus the Mediator for our Salvation. So that Chriſt is all, and doth all, and by Faith we receive and embrace Chriſt our Juſtifier. And ſo hath the Lord ordained, that by going out of our ſelves, and receiving Chriſt the Mediator, we have the Gift of Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151103:32"/> of Chriſt imputed to us, to the Juſtification of Life: So that it is not Faith as a Work, but Faith as a Hand or Inſtrument, whereby we receive Chriſt the Saviour, that juſtifies us in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I come to believe on the Lord Jeſus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>You muſt be convinced of Sin.</hi> You muſt ſee that you are guilty before God, that you cannot ſtand before the Holy Lord God. But alas! Mens hearts are ſo taken up with the Cares and Pleaſures of the world, and think ſo little of Eternity and the Judgment to come, that it is in the thoughts of few, how they ſhall be diſcharged from the guilt of their Sins, and have everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You muſt ſee that there is no help for you in your own perſonal Righteouſneſs.</hi> How can there, when you have ſinned already? And all the Righteouſneſs that you can perform in this Life, is defective and full of Imperfections? You muſt know that there muſt be a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to juſtifie you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You must know that Chriſt is he that is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to be the Saviour:</hi> That you can be ſaved only by his Blood and Righteouſneſs, and ſo caſt your ſelf wholly upon him. This Faith is the Gift of God. No man can come to Chriſt except the Father, which hath ſent him, draw him. And though ſome may think this believing in Chriſt, a notion, a fancy, or however a common or eaſy thing; yet as it is a real thing wrought in the hearts of the Elect
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151103:33"/> by the Spirit of God; ſo it is no eaſy thing to believe truly on Chriſt, when a ſinner is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Greatneſs of God, the Holineſs of his Law, the revenging Juſtice of God, and his own guilt and filth, it is a great work of God to fix and ſtay the heart upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; to deliver ſuch a one from going down to the pit, and bring the ſoul to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I dare not come to Christ, becauſe I do not know I am Elected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> You cannot know that you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, until you believe in Chriſt; by this you may know your Election, if the Goſpel of the Grace of God come to your heart with ſuch Power of the Holy Ghoſt, as to draw and fix your heart to Jeſus the Mediator.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. This Doctrine concerning believing in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151103:33"/> Chriſt, may teach us our great Blindneſs and Ignorance of the way of Life and Salvation, until ſome Goſpel-light ſhine upon us. Men are more eaſily convinced, that it is their Duty to pray to God, and to live ſoberly and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, than they are convinced of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of going out of themſelves to Chriſt, that they may have Everlaſting Life by believing on him. The way of the Goſpel is new and ſtrange, until the Holy Ghoſt convinces us of this way of Righteouſneſs and Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſtudy the Goſpel, ſtudy upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Mediator, hear him Preached, and the Lord draw our hearts effectually unto Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo believing on the Son, we may have the beginning of Everlaſting Life here, and the full enjoyment of it in Heaven.</p>

            <p>I Shall ſpend but a little time in the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe words, only take notice of two main things in this Chapter:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Narration of a great Miracle that Christ wrought, in healing a man, that had an infirmity thirty and eight years,</hi> verſ. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's Apology that he made for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jews for what he had done.</hi> It being upon the Sabbath-day, that Chriſt healed the man, they pretended that Chriſt had broaken the Sabbath; Verſ. 16. <hi>And therefore did the Jews perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabbath-day.</hi> The men of the world will always make ſome pretence to perſecute Chriſt and his People; but Chriſt Juſtifies his Action, in making the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151103:34"/> man whole upon the Sabbath-day: and though he might have Juſtified the act, as being a work of mercy, which may conſiſt with the moſt ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath; yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour vindicates himſelf upon a higher Ground and Reaſon, namely, by aſſerting his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and God-head. Saith he, Verſ. 17. <hi>My Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> worketh hitherto, and I work. Therfore the Jews ſought the more to kill him, becauſe he had not only broken the Sabbath</hi> (as they Ignorantly thought he had done) <hi>but ſaid alſo, that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God.</hi> Our Saviour ſheweth, that the Father worketh upon the Sabbath-day, in doing good, ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and kindneſs; yet with perfect reſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo doth the Son. He ſheweth how he being the Son of God, and equal with God, doth co-operate with the Father, in all his works, which the Father doth, Verſ. 20. yea, and that as Mediator God-man, the Father hath committed all unto him: He raiſeth Dead Bodies, and he raiſes Dead Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall Live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 28. Verſ. Our Saviour ſpeaks of his <hi>raiſing thoſe that are dead in their Graves:</hi> But in the Text, he ſpeaks of <hi>raiſing thoſe that are dead in their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have this great work of Chriſt in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing dead ſouls, ſet forth by Four circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:151103:35"/>1. By the <hi>Time</hi> when; <hi>The hour is coming, and now is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Means and way</hi> by which he would do this great work, of raiſing dead Souls; and that is by his voice: <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it; <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> I that am the Truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By an <hi>Atteſtation</hi> and Aſſeveration; <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> It ſhall be ſo, I atteſt it; <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Hour is coming, and now is.]</hi> Chriſt did always gather, and call, and make alive the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect people: But the time was now come, when he would ſend forth his Apoſtles to Preach amongſt the Gentiles, to gather the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect people that were ſcattered abroad: And therefore he ſaith, <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead</hi> (even amongſt the Gentiles) <hi>ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and live.</hi> And our Saviour ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, Joh. 10.15, 16. <hi>I lay down my Life for the ſheep. And other ſheep</hi> I <hi>have, which are not of this fold:</hi> (which are not of the people of the Jews) <hi>them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice</hi>—</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That thoſe that are ſpiritually dead, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, by hearing the voice of the Son of God, are made to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Epheſ. 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> that is the eſtate of all men by nature. But Chriſt can make
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151103:35"/> dead Souls alive: He can do it by a word, and as eaſily as we can ſpeak a word. You read of ſeveral that Chriſt raiſed up from bodily Death, when he was here upon the Earth, and he did it by ſpeaking to them, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.41. one was <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter, <hi>And he took the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel by the hand, and ſaid unto her,</hi> Tabitha cumi, <hi>which is being interpreted, Damſel, (I ſay unto thee) ariſe. And ſtraightway the Damſel aroſe.</hi> And the Widows Son, Luk. 7.14, 15. <hi>And he came and touched the Bier (and they that bare him ſtood ſtill) and he ſaid, I ſay unto thee youngman ariſe; and he that was dead ſate up and began to ſpeak.</hi> And ſo <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11. when he had been dead four days, verſ. 43, 44. <hi>He cried with a loud voice,</hi> Lazarus <hi>come forth; and he that was dead came forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Chriſt raiſed up thoſe that were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dead by his Voice, by his Word: So if he ſay the word, if he ſay to one that is dead in ſin, Riſe up, Come forth, the dead Soul ſhall live. <hi>Verily, verily, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the opening the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That by Nature we are Spiritually dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What that Life is that Chriſt gives to dead ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What this Voice of the Son of God is, by which dead ſinners are made to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What the Lord doth work upon thoſe that are dead in ſin, when he makes them ſpiritually alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151103:36"/>5. <hi>The Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That by Nature we are ſpiritually dead.</hi> You read of ſome that are <hi>dead whilſt they live,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6. And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead, but follow thou me.</hi> As the Body without the Soul is dead: So we now being without Chriſt, are dead men and women.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We are dead men in regard of the Sentence of Death and Condemnation paſt upon us by the Law.</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in every thing that is Written in the Book of the Law to do it.</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, for that all have ſinned.</hi> All our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi>'s houſe are but dead men before the Lord; we are all guilty before God: Though we are not executed, yet we are under the Sentence of Death by the Law; and the Sentence of the Law will be executed at laſt, if we be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We are dead men as to the life of Grace and true Holineſs.</hi> Our beſt works are but <hi>dead works.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Though, indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion we may do things that are good for the matter; yet we do nothing from a right principle, and to a right end, Joh. 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Except we have Spiritual Sap and Life from Chriſt, we can bring forth no true fruit, but are like a dead and withered Branch, that hath no life in it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:151103:36"/>2. <hi>What that Life is that Chriſt gives to dead Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Life of Juſtification.</hi> When we are united to Chriſt, the Sentence of Death by the Law is taken off. We uſe to ſay, that of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, when the Sentence of Death is paſſed upon him, that he is a dead man: But if once a Pardon come, that makes him a living man, then he cannot be executed. Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There was a heavy Sentence of Condemnation paſſed upon us by the Law; but now we are in Chriſt, we are pardoned in Chriſt, and now there is no Condemnation. Now as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We have from Chriſt the Life of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the life of Grace and Holineſs too,</hi> whereby the Soul hath a Spiritual Inclination and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to act towards God; according to that, Hebr. 8.10. <hi>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take the heart of ſtone out of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Preaching of the Life that Chriſt giveth, is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs. Some are fit to make a mock at Life and Juſtification by the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: And ſo likewiſe at Converſion, at the infuſing of Grace into the heart, wherby we come to live unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151103:37"/> God. But as theſe things are plainly revealed in the Scripture; ſo to them that believe, theſe things are precious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us enquire what we are to underſtand here, by the Voice of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Goſpel may be called the voice of the Son of God, as it is an Inſtrumental means to make dead Souls to live.</hi> The Goſpel is called, <hi>The Word of Grace,</hi> Acts 20.32. <hi>The Word of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>The Word of Life,</hi> Phil. 2.16. By the Diſpenſation and Preaching of the Goſpel, Chriſt conveyeth himſelf into our Souls. <hi>The Letter, the Law killeth;</hi> ſeeing we are ſinners, the Law is <hi>the miniſtration of death to us,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.7. It tells us we are dead men, curſed men, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth the wrath of God due to us for our ſins. The Law, through our default, cannot give us Life; becauſe we have not a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that the Law requires in our ſelves: But it is the Goſpel that reveals to us <hi>the new way to Life,</hi> that ſhews us an Attonement and Righteouſneſs in another. We can neither be juſtified by the Law, nor be ſanctified by it. We cannot be juſtified by it, becauſe we cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it. We cannot be ſanctified by it, becauſe it only commands us to obey, but giveth no new ſtrength; now we have loſt the Holineſs we had in <hi>Adam.</hi> 'Tis the Goſpel that reveals to us how we may be juſtified before God, and may have the Image of God renewed upon us.</p>
            <p>But to make us ſpiritually alive, there muſt be more than a bare Declaration of the Goſpel;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151103:37"/> many hear the Goſpel Preached many years, and yet never hear the voice of the Son of God and Live: Therefore here is more to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By the voice of the Son of God, is meant the Secret Efficacy and Power of the Spirit of Chriſt ſo put forth as to turn the heart to the Lord.</hi> As the Lord Jeſus did ſay to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was Dead, <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth, and at the ſame time put Life into him: So when the ſet time is come for the converſion of any of the Elect people, there goes forth ſuch a Power of Chriſt, as to put Spiritual Life into them. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may ſpeak and ſpend their ſtrength in calling to dead Souls to come forth, but except the Lord put in with them, ſo as to effect the work, men will ſtill abide in death.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Hearing preſuppoſeth Life, Therefore how is it ſaid, That they that hear the voice of the Son of God ſhall live? Can they hear before they live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This hearing the voice of the Son of God, and living Spiritually, are both at the ſame time. As <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when Chriſt bad him come forth, he heard and lived at the ſame time. Chriſt ſpeaking to the heart with ſuch Power, as to turn the heart to himſelf; goes before Spiritual Life, in order of Nature, but not in order of Time. Converſion is a work of Spiritual Creation, and ſo is not like other things: The Lord ſaith live, and the Soul li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:151103:38"/>4. <hi>Let us enquire what the Lord works upon a man dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, to make him live Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtand to ſpeak of what the Lord doth by way of <hi>Preparation</hi> for the Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt; this muſt be <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> that the Lord doth ſet our ſins in order before us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of Sin and of Judgment to come: But the very thing by which we are tranſlated from Death to Life, is the Lords <hi>giving us his Spirit to unite us to Chriſt,</hi> whereby we receive the Life of Juſtification and Sanctification from him. The Lord gives <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17. <hi>God who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. The Sinner was convinced of his loſt eſtate before, and now there comes a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Light into the heart to reveal Chriſt, ſo as to enable the Soul to ſee Chriſt held forth in the Promiſes, and to receive him. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Now the Soul ſaith, It is ſo indeed; 'tis worthy of all acceptation: the Soul now is wrought by the Spirit to approve, and like this way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and heartily cloſe with it. Now the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is enlightned, and the Will recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and brought to embrace Chriſt. It is the Lord that makes this change, <hi>He worketh in us to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. Every one that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151103:38"/> is converted receives Chriſt, Joh. 1.12. <hi>But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his Name.</hi> Though it may be, that the Souls receiving Chriſt at firſt is ſcarce diſcerned; but afterwards by renewing acts of Faith upon Chriſt, and by the effects of Union with Chriſt, we may come to ſee that we have received Chriſt, and are made partakers of Spiritual Life. There is a certain <hi>moment of time,</hi> when a man hath Spiritual Life put into him; he heareth the voice of the Son of God and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: But the work is ſo ſecret and myſterious, that it is hard for us to ſay, that juſt ſuch a day, ſuch an hour, we heard the voice of the Son of God and lived. Though ſome may be able to know the time, yet not all that are made alive by Chriſt. But we find by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the acts and effects of Spiritual Life; whereby we may know, that we have heard the voice of the Son of God and live.</p>
            <p>When we receive Chriſt, then we are made alive indeed: for wheras we were under the ſentence of death, by the Law; now we are forgiven all treſpaſſes, and have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us: And thoſe that receive this gift of Righteouſneſs, are not only freed from Hell, but ſhall reign in life by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>When we truly receive Chriſt, we are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alſo. Together with the Faith that the Lord gives us to receive Chriſt for our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he alſo gives his Spirit to work in us a Principle of Holineſs, and new obedience, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151103:39"/> we may be both in repect of Juſtification and Sanctification alive from the Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Here we may ſee the miſerable eſtate that every man and woman is in, that hath not heard the voice of Christ.</hi> Brethren and beloved, do you believe this, that dead ſinners are made alive by hearing the voice of the Son of God? Then thoſe that never yet heard the voice of the Son of God, they are yet dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins.</p>
            <p>If you never yet heard the voice of Chriſt, then you are dead men; all your ſins are upon you, you are under the ſentence of death by the Law; and if you never come to hear the voice of the Son of God, this ſentence of Death will be upon you for ever.</p>
            <p>And if you never yet heard the voice of Chriſt, to put ſpiritual life into you, then you are dead alſo as to any Life of Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Thoſe works that you are ready to be proud of, and glory in, they are all but dead works; and you do not truly ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, we hope we have heard the voice of Chriſt, we have heard many able Miniſters, many good Sermons, we have had the Word opened to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is a Priviledg indeed, to have the Word Preached to you; but it is not the voice of a man, no nor of the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if they ſhould ſpeak to you, that can put
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151103:39"/> Spiritual Life into you, except withal you hear the voice of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore, If you never yet heard the voice of Chriſt, to make the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel effectual to your Souls; I ſay unto every ſuch perſon, as God ſaid to <hi>Abimilech,</hi> Gen. 20.3. <hi>Thou art but a dead man,</hi> thou art a Sinner, and the wages of Sin is Death; thou art a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man, and thou haſt no Life of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs neither; Therefore conſider your caſe and condition.</p>
            <p>Examine your ſelves, Whether the Word Preached hath had that power upon your hearts to draw you to Chriſt, and to turn you from your Iniquities.</p>
            <p>Objection. <hi>If that we hear the Word Preached by men, yet you ſay, that except we hear the voice of the Son of God, we cannot live: then to what purpoſe ſhould we attend upon the Preaching of the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is your <hi>Duty</hi> to hear what God the Lord ſpeaketh by his Servants and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and though the Word Preached cannot Convert you, without the Voice and Power of Chriſt; yet it may pleaſe the Lord, at one time or other, to make the Preaching of the Word effectual upon your hearts, as he hath done to others.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>See the exceeding greatneſs of Chriſt's Power.</hi> He is able to make dead Souls to live; he is able to quicken thoſe who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; a work which neither Men nor Angels can do: Yea, know and take
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151103:40"/> notice, That it is no labour, no difficulty to Chriſt to make dead Souls live: He can do it eaſily and ſuddenly, He can do it with a word, He can do it as eaſily as you or I can ſpeak a word. The Text ſaith, <hi>That the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Uſe 3. <hi>Of Direction to thoſe that have heard the voice of the Son of God,</hi> and are now quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are made alive.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſs and praiſe the Lord;</hi> ſtand and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at what the Lord hath done for you. If any of you had been dead, and in the Grave, and Chriſt had ſaid to you as he did to <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> come forth, and ſo you had been raiſed but from a bodily death, to live again, this had been a great wonder: But this is a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wonder. O! therefore bleſs the Lord, ſay this, my Soul was Dead and is alive. I was under the Sentence of Death for the Breach of the Law, and now I am pardoned. I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any life of holineſs, and now the Lord hath given me a new Heart, a new Spirit. Thus when I lay in my Blood, the Lord ſaid unto me, Live.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Trust in the Lord to perform all things for you.</hi> If you have heard the voice of the Son of God and Live, then you have had experience of the Power of Chriſt indeed. Therefore truſt in the Lord in all difficulties. Say as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 62.1. <hi>Truly my Soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my Salvation.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him.</hi> You can ſpeak it by experience, that Power belongeth unto God, and that alſo unto the Lord belongeth Mercy.

            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Be willing to do or ſuffer any thing for Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be willing to live to him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhews that it is but reaſonable that we ſhould live unto the Lord, not only as we are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but alſo upon the account of Grace. 2 Cor. 14.15. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them and roſe again.</hi> Thoſe that live by Chriſt, it is but reaſonable that they ſhould live to him. We muſt not of all others, live to our ſelves; beſides, our old obligation to obedience,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151103:41"/> which we owe to God, as our Creator and Soveraign Lord: Grace lays a further obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us to live to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be willing to dye for him, if he call us to it.

            <p>THe words before going, <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>No Man received his Teſtimony, though he teſtifie nothing but what he had ſeen and heard in Heaven: and no man received his Teſtimony: and yet here immediately it follows,</hi> that <hi>He that hath received his Teſtimony ſays,</hi> that <hi>God is True.

And here in this Verſe, <hi>John</hi> doth declare the Commendation of thoſe that did receive Chriſt, and what matter of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to thoſe that do receive Chriſts Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: Why, he ſays, they do exceedingly Honour and Glorifie God; they do ſubſcribe as it were with their Hand, and ſet their Seal
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151103:42"/> to the Truth of God; that what the Lord ſpeaks, and Chriſt ſpeaks, and what God the Father ſpeaks, is Truth; and in doing this, they Honour and Glorifie God by ſubſcribing and ſetting to their Seal, <hi>that God is True.</hi> As he ſays, <hi>he that ſet to his Seal that God is true, doth Teſtify of what is Truth.</hi> But how doth it appear that the Spirit is given unto thoſe that Teſtify of him? You may ſee it cleared in the opening of the Propoſition. So that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is this; taking up the words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Propoſ. <hi>Whoſoever he be that doth receive the Teſtimony of Chriſt, doth ſet to his Seal that God it True.</hi>

            <p>You heard before in the opening of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer clauſe, what we are to underſtand by the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and then what we are to underſtand of the receiving the Teſtimony of Chriſt. By the Teſtimony of Chriſt we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Goſpel of Life and Salvation held forth to poor Sinners: that you heard cleared from Scripture; and for the receiving of it, what is it to receive it? it is not only a receiving it into the underſtandings, and alſo into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and receiving it with ſome kind of Joy and Gladneſs; but alſo a receiving it into the Heart and Soul in a way of Faith and Believing. Believing is receiving the Teſtimony of Chriſt. I ſhall not ſtand to ſpeak of theſe things, but ſhall now ſhew you, that that Teſtimony that every believing Soul doth give of Jeſus Chriſt, doth ſet to his Seal, <hi>that God is true.</hi>

               </gap> that God is true and faithful in his Word, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſpeaks in his Goſpel: as that which the Evangeliſts in the Goſpel ſpeaks of in the Teſtimony of Chriſt is true. When God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his name by <hi>Moſes,</hi> he ſays of him, <hi>He is abundant in goodneſs and in truth;</hi> he is as abundant in his truth (every way) as in his goodneſs. And in another place its ſaid, <hi>God is not as Man, that he ſhould lye: hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not do it?</hi> And ſo I might multiply Scriptures to that purpoſe; the Truth of God is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting: whatſoever he ſpeaks, it ſhall be; what he hath ſpoken with his mouth, he will fulfil. <hi>Every man,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>are Lyars: Let God be true and every man a Lyar:</hi> in reſpect of God it is even ſo. And ſo in the <hi>New-Teſtament, God is a God that cannot Lye.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with his infinite Nature; He cannot Lye; yet it is impoſſible for God to Lye. He muſt ceaſe to be God, were it ever ſo.</p>
            <p>But it muſt needs be ſo, Brethren, that God is a God of Truth: for God is the Author of all truth; He is the Fountain of Truth, and you know a Fountain cannot contain ſweet waters and bitter; He is Light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151103:43"/> at all; He is Truth it ſelf, and no Lye there can be no falſhood at all in him; He is the Author of Truth; the Devil is the Author of Lyes, and the founder of them: the Devil is the Father of Lyes, and therefore God cannot be the Father of them, but he is the Author of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gain, it cannot be that God ſhould ſpeak that which is not truth, which he doth not intend; for God is an unalterable God, an unchangeable God: He don't ſpeak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak again, but he is Immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, the ſame to day, and forever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhaddow of turning. In our ſpeaking there's change, and ſhaddow of turning; but there is no ſhaddow of change or turnings in God: He ſays not one thing, and intends another. If God ſhould promiſe Life and Salvation unto all thoſe that lay hold of Righteouſneſs and Life, and then they fall ſhort of it, here were change and ſhaddow of turning; but there's no ſhaddow nor turnings in God.</p>
            <p>Again, God muſt needs be a God of Truth, becauſe he loves Truth; <hi>Thou loveſt Truth in the inward parts.</hi> God loves truth in the Heart, and God loves Truth in the Lips too. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe Lips is no guile.</hi> See how God threatens to puniſh a Lyar: <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Holy place, any thing that defileth, or any thing that makes a Lye.</hi> And ſo in another place, <hi>without are Dogs, Idolaters, and Adulterers, and Lyars.</hi> See how the Lord alſo doth threaten the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151103:43"/> had made a Covenant with the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 17.13.15, 16. <hi>Shall he proſper? ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things? &amp;c. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ſurely in the place where the King dwelleth that made him King, whoſe Oath he deſpiſed, and whoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he brake, even with him in the midſt of Babylon, he ſhall die for it.</hi> And it's a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtory of the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> he entered into a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the <hi>Turks,</hi> whereupon, a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Pope by one of his Cardinals, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> to break his Covenant, and to come into his Country with an Army; and the <hi>Turk</hi> ſeeing his Army, with the Banner of Chriſts Name upon it; he cried out, <hi>O Chriſt, come and take Judgement on him that hath thus broken Covenant with the Lord;</hi> and the Lord did give Victory to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and he took the King and cut off his Head; and this for breach of Covenant. And ſo in other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſays God, <hi>your Carcaſſes ſhall lye down in the Wilderneſs;</hi> and ſo in 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 2.30. and Chapt. 3.13. See what courſe the Lord will take with the Houſe of <hi>Eli, Wherefore I the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I ſaid indeed, that thy Houſe, and the Houſe of thy Father ſhould walk before me for ever:</hi> But now the Lord ſaith, <hi>be it far from me: for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why, then it ſeems the Lord is not ſo faithful in his Word: for ſometimes the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151103:44"/> Lord doth not make good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. <hi>How then is he true and faithful in what he doth?</hi> tho' this is not the buſineſs I principally intend; yet for anſwer, in a word:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Promiſes that God makes unto particular perſons or people, eſpecially unto Temporal good things and Bleſſings, they are made conditionally, <hi>viz. If they don't walk ſo and ſo: Or if they don't repent.</hi> As now for example, That threatning made to <hi>Niniveh;</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Niniveh doth return,</hi> that is the meaning of it; Tho' its not always expreſt, yet it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways implied, That if they do not repent, they ſhall dye, or they ſhall be deſtroyed. So now, God promiſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they ſhould have the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is conditionally, to take heed how they walk before him, and commit no Idolatry; but now they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in Idolatry, the Lord fails them; why? becauſe they did not walk uprightly before him, but ſinned againſt him with their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And alſo his Promiſe is, if they did put a difference between the precious and the vile, then I would do ſo and ſo; But now thou haſt done ſo and ſo; and tho' I have ſaid ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not done ſo and ſo, you ſhall not enjoy the mercies I have promiſed. They are not always performed, becauſe they are conditional; but God is true and faithful in what he promiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what are we to underſtand of the ſetting to the Seal? What is this ſame ſetting of the ſeal to it, that God is true?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:151103:44"/>
            <p>Breifly, It ſignifies thus much, namely, a bringing, or giving a ſtrong Witneſs that God is True; for the ſetting to the Seal, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a promiſe by word ſubſcribing, but alſo by ſetting of the Seal to thing. See <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> 9. laſt Verſe. <hi>Eſther.</hi> 8.8. The King is making impreſſion with his Seal upon the writing, for the enlargement of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it's ſaid, the Kings Seal no man may pluck off. You know it is ordinary, the Sealing to a thing is the confirming of a thing: Circumciſion was as a Sign or Seal of ſtrong Confirmation, that Righteouſneſs ſhould be had in a way of faith and beleiving: And ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Are not you the Seal of my Apoſtleſhip?</hi> That is, yea are my Witneſs and ſtrong Teſtimony, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and clear, that I am an Apoſtle ſent of God, becauſe of the effects of that Miniſtry you ſee and find by me. And ſo in another place, <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his, having this Seal, that every one that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the name of Chriſt ſhould depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Here is a double Seal, here is the Seal of Gods election, chuſing from Eternity, <hi>the Lord knows who are his;</hi> but alſo more ſecret, <hi>Let him that receiveth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> But how is this an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration that God is true? why thus, in receiving of the Teſtimony of God, there's a ſtrong evidence that God is True.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that he doth now deny himſelf; every Man and Woman that doth receive Chriſt by Faith, doth deny themſelves; all a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151103:45"/> mans own Righteouſneſs, his own Services, or performances: He doth not look ever to be accepted of the Lord for any thing that he doth or can do: not that he neglects Duty, and Services, and performances; but when he hath done all, yet all his hopes and expectations for any thing of whatſoever he hath done, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing but acceptance in Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> man will come after me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he muſt deny himſelf and follow me.</hi> He muſt renounce all, look for no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God for all that ever he ſuffers, or can ſuffer for the Name of God: The Soul will deny all, deny it ſelf, its own Liberty, its name and credit, its Life and all. Again,</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man that doth receive the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt, as he doth deny all, ſo now he doth give up himſelf, and lay the weight of his eternal condition upon Chriſt. Says the Apoſtle, <hi>I know in whom I have believed: and I am perſwaded; and know that he is ſufficient to keep whatſoever is needful for me. I have ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my eternity for it, and upon it, and my Soul muſt ſink if Chriſt don't take care of me, and ſave me for ever.</hi> He renounces all his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and lays the weight of his Soul upon Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A man that doth receive the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt, hath ſet to his Seal, that God is true. He did ſet to his Seal that Chriſt is true, but how doth he ſet to his Seal that God is true? yes, for he whom God hath ſent, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the word unto you; Chriſt is ſent of God,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151103:45"/> and he ſpeaks nothing but what he had from God. Briefly by way of Application:</p>
            <p>Uſe. 1. If God be a God of Truth, it doth concern every one of us to endeavour to be like unto God. God is a God of Truth, and what he ſpeaks is Truth. God is a God of Truth that cannot lye, it's impoſſible for God to Lye.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. It's a word of encouragement to every one of us this day that are before the Lord, to receive the Teſtimony that God gives us, to beleive what Jeſus Chriſt doth ſpeak, becauſe what he ſpeaks is the Word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word of the God of Truth, and is that whereby you do exceedingly Honour and Glorify God. It's ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> He belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and gave glory unto God. Who is there that would not ſay, he is willing to glorify God, Honour him; you would be willing to teſtifie to this truth, that God is truth; and if you had a Hundred Seals, or if it were to ſet a Thouſand ſeals to it that God is Truth, you would do it. O receive the Goſpel in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, you that have not yet received it, and lay the weight of your Souls, your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes, upon Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, and expect Salvation, and Righteouſneſs, and Life, meerly for that the Lord hath called you hereunto; and here is encouragement, becauſe you cannot Honour and Glorifie God more than in believing.</p>

            <p>HAving ſpoken ſomewhat largely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of Faith, from another Scripture, I ſhall deſire a little to go on to back it. And Oh that the Lord would back it by his Spirit; and therefore I have choſen this portion of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Briefly a little for the Coherence.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (for moſt probably he was the Pen-man of this Epiſtle) having in the former Chapter exhorted theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom he wrote, to perſevere, and to be conſtant in the Faith, taking an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the danger of the contrary, in the latter end of the Chapter, <hi>If any man draw back, or do not perſevere, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Now I ſay, having exhorted them to perſevere in the Faith, both in the Doctrine of Faith, and in the Grace of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151103:46"/> Faith, he comes in this Chapter to commend the Grace of Faith to them. And that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By laying down a deſcription of it; for ſays he, <hi>This grace of Faith doth make thoſe things that are abſent (whether paſt or future) as if they were preſent; if we look by faith back upon the creation of the World, and ſee how the World was made out of nothing, Faith will help us to look upon it as preſent; and ſo we may look upon thoſe things that are to come; and faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, whether paſt or to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, Secondly, he commends Faith by the excellent effects of it, that have been found in the Faithful in all Ages, from the beginning of the World until the coming of Chriſt; for if you obſerve it, look upon the Chapter, and you will find that he gives inſtances and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, both of thoſe faithful that were before the Flood, and alſo of ſuch as were after the Flood, to the giving of the Law; and then alſo of thoſe faithful ones that lived after the Law until the Capivity; and then of thoſe that lived after the Captivity until the coming of Chriſt: all theſe he inſtances in this Chapter. Now firſt, for theſe Faithful ones that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, and the effects of Faith in them; here he does lay down and mention three examples eſpecially:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He does inſtance in the example of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and of the effects of Faith in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He doth inſtance alſo in faithful <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> and the Effects of his Faith.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:151103:47"/>
            <p>And Thirdly, The example of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the effects of his Faith. And what was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral effect of their Faith? Why, the great and General effect of all their Faith was, that by their Faith they pleaſed God. Says he, firſt for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> at the 4th Verſe, <hi>Abel he offered up a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by Faith that pleaſed God;</hi> by Faith <hi>Abel</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> or a more pleaſing Sacrifice than <hi>Cain;</hi> it was by Faith that his offering was pleaſing unto God. And again, he inſtances in <hi>Enoch, By Faith Enoch walked with God; and pleaſed God:</hi> for ſo he ſays expreſly at the latter end of the 5th <hi>Verſe,</hi> that he had this Teſtimony, <hi>that he pleaſed God.</hi> And then for <hi>Noah,</hi> he alſo by his Faith pleaſed God. How does that appear? why, he found Grace and Favour with God; God inſtructed him to build an Ark, whereby he and his Family might be preſerved in the time of the General Flood. He found Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, and that was by Faith; for ſo the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>By faith No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah being warned of God of things not ſeen, as yet moved with fear prepared an Ark,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But now this Scripture that I have read unto you, it is from the commendation of the Faith of <hi>Enoch, Enoch by Faith he pleaſed God;</hi> for ſo ſaies the Apoſtle at the latter end of the 5. <hi>Verſe,</hi> juſt before the Text, <hi>before his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God.</hi> He had this Teſtimony, where had he this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? And where ſhall we find this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerning <hi>Enoch?</hi> The place to which the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151103:47"/> Apoſtle does here refer and relate to, is that in the 5 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the 22, 23, 24. Verſes. If you conſult the place, you will find never a word ſpoken that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly; it is ſaid <hi>Enoch walked with God, after he begat Methuſalah, three Hundred Years, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Sons and Daughters: and all the days of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch were three hundred Sixty and Five Years; and Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</hi> Where is here any word expreſſed that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God? Yet ſaies the Apoſtle in this place, <hi>He had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God?</hi> why, it muſt be in this place or no where; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no where expreſly ſaid that he pleaſed God. How then could the Apoſtle ſay here, that <hi>he had a Teſtimony that he pleaſed God?</hi> For anſwer, though it be not ſaid in expreſs terms that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God, yet here is that ſpoken for the ſubſtance of it, that is equivolent to it; for in that it is ſaid, <hi>He walked with God,</hi> it holds forth that he pleaſed God; for can two walk together if they be not agreed, if they be not pleaſing one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? can <hi>Enoch</hi> walk with God, if God was not pleaſed with him? the very expreſſing of it again and again, that <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> it holds forth this Teſtimony, that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God. And again, the Lords taking of him to himſelf, in a more than ordinary way and manner, is a plain Teſtimony that he pleaſed God. Now ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>He had this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before his Tranſlation, that he pleaſed God; he walked with God, and God took him.</hi> Here
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151103:48"/> was a plain Teſtimony that he pleaſed God: Now this was by Faith, that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God; ſo the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>By faith Enoch was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated that he ſhould not ſee Death;</hi> and <hi>He had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God.</hi> And ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>This Faith is that whereby a Soul comes to pleaſe God;</hi> and not only ſo, <hi>but is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is only pleaſed; by Faith only God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a perſon, and without Faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God.</hi> The Apoſtle does not ſay here, that no man ever did yet pleaſe God without Faith; he does not only ſay, that no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live does pleaſe God without Faith, nor no man that ever ſhall live in the World ſhall pleaſe God without Faith; no, but he ſpeaks a greater word, <hi>It is impoſſible that ever any man or Woman in the World ſhould pleaſe God without Faith; without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are a plain Propoſition, and I ſhall take them as the Apoſtle lays them down: Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That <hi>it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman ever to pleaſe God without Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It does imply, indeed, that by Faith a Man or Woman does come to pleaſe God; for when he ſaies, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> he does imply, that by Faith a man or Woman does pleaſe him; but it is only by Faith that a Man or Woman can pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Friends, this point may be of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than poſſibly ſome of you are aware
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151103:48"/> of; hereby the general miſtake of many (if not of moſt) Chriſtians, may be diſcovered, many, and the generality of Chriſtians are ready to think that they pleaſe God with the performance of their Duties day by day; they call upon the Name of God, and they are frequently attending upon the Word of God; and they do deſire alſo to live uprightly, and to walk conſcienciouſly in their callings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is the way whereby they think to pleaſe God: I do not ſpeak againſt theſe things; but I ſay, if this be the way to pleaſe God, then why doth the Apoſtle ſay here, that <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him?</hi> then it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by my Prayers, nor by all the Duties and Services that I can perform, nor by all my up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and cloſe walking in my converſation; no ſaies he, <hi>when you have done all you can, if you fall ſhort of this Faith, you cannot pleaſe God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi> Hereby, I ſay, Chriſtians may ſee their general miſtake whereby they may be miſtaken, and it is about a matter of very great concernment, about pleaſing or diſpleaſing God; and again, it is of concernment alſo to direct us and ſet us in a right way, whereby we may come to pleaſe God indeed; well then, to enter upon the point (through the Lords aſſiſtance) I ſhall deſire for the proſecution of it, to ſpeak to theſe four or five particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſhew you what it is that the Apoſtle here means by pleaſing God, when he ſaies, that without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:151103:49"/>2. That this pleaſing of God is a matter of very great concernment, that the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, when he ſpeaks of it ſo as he does, that it is a moſt deſirable thing for a Man or Woman to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is that Faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and by which a man or woman doth come to pleaſe God? That is worth the inquiring after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Shew you, that by Faith (though a Man or Woman may have many failings) yet by Faith, he comes to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, To ſhew you, That <hi>without Faith it is utterly impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> whatever Man or Woman doth in this world beſides, yet if he fall ſhort of this Faith he cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Then, <hi>What is this ſame pleaſing of God that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, By pleaſing of God, we are not to underſtand meerly God's approving a thing; God doth approve of the Creatures that he hath made, and approves of them for good; the Creatures that came out of Gods hand, for the ſubſtance of them, they are good; when God had made the World, he looked back and did review all the creatures that he had made, and he did declare and pronounce that they were all very good; this is an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the creatures that he had made: but this is not ſuch a pleaſing of God as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſpeaks of; the ſubſtance of all the creatures in themſelves are good, the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151103:49"/> in the ſubſtance of them are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And again, the actions and works that Men and Women do, they may ſometimes be good for the ſubſtance of them, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God may not be pleaſed with them. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, Oh man (Micah</hi> 6.8.) <hi>what is good, to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> The ſubſtance of thoſe Actions, God doth approve of them, and yet notwithſtanding for the manner of doing them, God may not be pleaſed. Well, then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively,</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What is this ſame pleaſing of God by what we do? or when may God be ſaid to be pleaſed with the things that a Man or Woman doth? Namely, in ſhort, for I muſt not inlarge; When as the Lord hath a Gracious reſpect unto the things that a perſon doth, when he have a gracious reſpect to his Duties and Services, and alſo doth graciouſly accept of them, and take a kind of complacency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, then is he well pleaſed with them. As now for example, you read of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 4.4, 5. He went and offered a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie unto God, and ſo did <hi>Cain</hi> too; but ſaies the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Abel and to his Offering, but he had no reſpect to Cain and to his Offering.</hi> God ſaw what <hi>Cain</hi> did too, in offering, and the offering might be good and acceptable in it ſelf, but being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by <hi>Cain,</hi> God had not reſpect to <hi>Cain</hi> nor to his offering; he did not accept of it as performed and done by him; ſo when God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151103:50"/> hath not only a gracious reſpect to the duties and ſervices a man perſorms, but does graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept of them, with a kind of complacency, he ſmells a ſweet ſavour in them, then he is pleaſed with them: As it it is ſaid concerning <hi>Noah</hi>'s Offering, in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 7.21. <hi>Noah,</hi> after he came out of the Ark, he offered a Sacrifice to God of the clean Beaſts that he had in the Ark with him; and its ſaid, God ſmelled a ſweet ſavour of reſt in his Noſtrils from that Sacrifice; God had not only a gracious reſpect to it, and looked with a gracious aſpect upon it, but God did take a kind of delight, and ſavour, and reliſh in it; as a man doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that he ſmells a ſweet ſavour in; it is ſaid, the Lord ſmell'd a ſweet ſavour of Reſt, a ſweet ſmell came up into his Noſtrils from <hi>Noah</hi>'s ſacrifice; The Truth is (Brethren) a Man or Woman may ſometimes do thoſe very things that God requires, (I pray mark it) I ſay, a Man or Woman may perform thoſe very duties that God requires, and yet God may not ſmell a ſweet ſavour in them, take no delight nor complacency in them, nor have no reſpect to them: As now for example, you know the Lord anointed <hi>Jehu</hi> to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. You ſhall find when the Lord anointed him by his Prophet, it was for this very end and purpoſe, that he ſhould go and Deſtroy all the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and cut them all off; well, <hi>Jehu</hi> went and performed the work; one would think this was pleaſing to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for he did the very thing that God
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151103:50"/> required; and yet I pray look into <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.4. You ſhall ſee what a Teſtimony the Holy Ghoſt gives of <hi>Jehu</hi> concerning the Work he did, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto the Prophet, call his Name Jezreel: for yet a little while, and I will avenge the Blood of Jezreel upon the Houſe of Jehu, &amp;c.</hi> I will be avenged, ſaies God, for that Blood; why, did not <hi>Jehu</hi> do that which God did expreſly require of him, in cutting off the Houſe of <hi>Ahab?</hi> And yet ſaies the Lord, I will be avenged for that Murder that <hi>Jehu</hi> Committed. Why ſo? Truly <hi>Jehu</hi> did not do it in that manner that was pleaſing unto God, for <hi>Jehu</hi> had his own ends in what he did; he made account of cutting off the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that his own Kingdom might be better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and therefore he ſtill maintained the Calves that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had ſet up; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will avenge the Blood of Jezreel upon the Houſe of Jehu.</hi> And ſaies the Lord, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.13, 14. When he ſpeaks concerning the Sacrifices, Offerings, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which he himſelf had apppointed, <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations; Incenſe is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me; your new Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is and Sabbaths, and ſolemn Aſſemblies I cannot away with.</hi> Why, had not God expreſly appointed theſe things? yes; yet ſaies God, <hi>Your new Moons and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Feaſts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them; and when you ſpread forth your hands, ſaies God, I will hide my Eyes; and when you make many prayers, I will not hear you.</hi> Why, were not theſe the things that God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151103:51"/> had required and commanded? yet you ſee God was not pleaſed with them; but now when the Lord doth look with a gracious reſpect upon a mans Services and performances, and alſo doth graciouſly accept them with complacency and delight, this is now to pleaſe the Lord by what we do. Well, this is the firſt thing; you ſee what is meant by pleaſing of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now then to come to the ſecond, That this pleaſing of God is a very deſirable thing; it is of great concernment for a Man or Woman to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>What can a man or woman deſire to do more in this World, than to pleaſe God? this indeed is implyed here in the Text, he ſpeaks of it as a thing very deſirable, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> To do that which is ſo deſirable; if it were not deſirable, what ſhould a man or woman need to care whether he pleaſe God or no? but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as a great thing, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Brethren, when a man or woman doth perform a Duty or Service, when he hath done it, if he do not pleaſe God in it, this is matter of very great ſadneſs to ſuch a Soul, or it ſhould be ſo; you know how <hi>Cain</hi> took it, he brought an Offering, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 4. of the fruits of the Ground, unto God, but God was not pleaſed with it; <hi>God had reſpect to Abel, and to his Offering; but to Cain and his Offering God had not reſpect.</hi> Well how did <hi>Cain</hi> take it? He was not able to bear it, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151103:51"/> fell: Gods accepting of <hi>Abels</hi> offering and not <hi>Cains,</hi> it went to the Heart of him, his Countenance fell, and thereupon he grew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious againſt his Brother, and at laſt he ſlew him; it was ſuch a dreadful thing to him, that God ſhould not accept of his Sacrifice as well as his Brothers. And you ſhall ſee King <hi>Saul,</hi> though but a wicked man, yet when God did refuſe to hear his Prayers, and was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them, ſaies he, <hi>I am ſore diſtreſſed,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. And he goes to a Witch, who raiſed up (as he thought) <hi>Samuel</hi> to him, and <hi>Saul</hi> anſwered, <hi>I am ſorely diſtreſſed, the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines make War againſt me, and God is departed from me; and he anſwereth me no more, neither by Prophets, nor by Dreams,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am ſorely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed.</hi> And Brethren, what is that which the people of God do ſo much deſire in this world, that they are Ambitious of it, as the main thing of their deſire in the World? It is, that they may pleaſe God, ſee the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Wherefore we Labour,</hi> ſaies he, the word ſignifies we are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, it is an emphatical word, we deſire ambitiouſly, we do earneſtly endeavour, as an ambitious man doth after Honour; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Labour:</hi> But the word is a ſtronger word, we labour with might and main, we make it our very ambition that we may be accepted of him, or that we may pleaſe God; it is the higheſt degree of the deſire of our Souls, we are ambitious for that, that we may pleaſe God, and that God may be pleaſed with us, and accept of our ſervices.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:151103:52"/>
            <p>But more particularly, to ſhew you in ſome particulars what a deſirable thing it is to be found pleaſing of God; and to have our ſervices accepted of him. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it not a deſirable thing for a Man or Woman to be reconciled to God, and to have God reconciled to them, and ſo to have peace with God? Now, when God comes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a mans duties and ſervices, it is an Argument that God is reconciled to him, and at peace with him; for before reconciliation, every Man and Woman in the World is an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Now, if any one ſhould come and offer Service to you, and you know he hath enmity in his mind againſt you, you will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any thing he does, though he pretend never ſo fairly. Now when God comes really to accept of a Mans ſervices and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is an Argument God is at peace with him, and is not that a moſt deſirabe thing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not a deſirable thing for a man or woman to have libetty to make uſe of the creatures that God gives him, with joyfulneſs of Heart, that he may rejoice in what he doth make uſe of, and partake of? Now, when a Man or Woman comes to know that his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are accepted of God, and that he hath pleaſed God in what he hath done, truly then he may go his way, as I remember <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks to that purpoſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and Drink thy drink with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy Work, God is pleaſed with what you do.</hi> Ay, now you
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151103:52"/> have cauſe to go and rejoyce in what you do enjoy, now you may go and eat and drink with gladneſs, with a merry heart; it's true, the men of the World can be jovial in their Cups, eating and drinking, and carouſing, and none ſeem to be ſo merry and jovial as they are, but they have no cauſe for it; it is juſt like a Condemned perſon, that may be jovial, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, and he know not how ſoon he may be called to Execution, this is the caſe of every Man and Woman in the World, if God do not accept of their Works: But now ſaies <hi>Solomon, Go thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not a deſirable thing to have the Creatures ready to be ſerviceable and officious to a man or woman? that there is never a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World but is ready to be Officious and Serviceable to him; though poſſiby they may ſeem to be averſe, and contrary, and croſs to him, yet they are all Serviceable and Officious to him; to have every thing turn to good to a Man or Woman, whatever any Creature do to him, it turns all to his good, though the Creature may intend otherwiſe. The wicked men may intend to perſecute, and perſecute them as Enemies, but when a man or woman pleaſe God, and his ways pleaſe God, all his Enemies ſhall be made his Friends, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a Mans ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh his Enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> They ſhall be Friends to him, they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151103:53"/> ſhall do Offices and ſervices of Friendſhip and kindneſs to him, though poſſibly againſt their wills; all the creatures ſhall be officious and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them, and they ſhall not be able to do them any hurt: what a deſirable thing is this?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not a deſirable thing for a man or woman to have an audience of all their prayers in Heaven? for God to be ready to hear our requeſts and petitions that we put up to him? is not this a deſirable thing? You will ſay, Oh that I were but ſure that God did but hear any one Prayer that ever I made, what a deſirable thing is this! now thoſe whoſe ways are pleaſing to the Lord God, do hear their prayers, <hi>They have acceſs to the Throne of Grace with boldneſs, to find grace and mercy to help in the time of need, Heb.</hi> 4.16. and mark the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles expreſſion, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. <hi>And whatſoever we ask, we receive of him.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight.</hi> If we be ſure we do thoſe things that are pleaſing to God; Now, ſaies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, we know that whatſoever we ask, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, we have now an audience of our prayers and petitions in Heaven; Oh! what a deſirable thing is this!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Is it not a deſirable thing for a man or woman to be a Favourite in the Court of Heaven? to be in ſpecial favour with the King of Heaven? you count it no ſmall matter to be a Favourite in the Kings Court, to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King; you count it a very deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151103:53"/> thing; Truly to be a favourite in the Court of Heaven is much more deſirable; to be in favour with the great King of kings; I tell you the favour of God in Heaven, is as Life to a mans Soul; <hi>David</hi> could ſay it, that knew it by experience, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 30.5. <hi>In thy favour is Life;</hi> nay, he adds a greater word than that, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi> There is nothing in the world to a Man better than life; but to know that a man or Woman is in favour with God, he hath that which is better than life. Brethren and Friends, there are but two great things that a Man or Woman ſhould deſire in this World, which are the general and comprehenſive of all things to be deſired; one is, to enjoy peace with God, and the favour of God here; and the other is to enjoy the favour, and ſee the face of God in Heaven hereafter: What can a man deſire more than to be at peace with God, and have the favour of God whilſt he live, and then to know that he ſhall ſee and enjoy the face and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for ever in Glory? Here is as much as can be deſired; and theſe two things we ſhould look after: Now here is one of them, To know that God is well pleaſed with a poor Creature; now ſuch a perſon is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven, and he may be ſure of it; if he be in favour with God here, then he ſhall ſee the face of God, and enjoy the preſence of God hereafter: That is the 5th.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, to add but that, Is it not a deſirable thing for a Man or Woman to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151103:54"/> to look Death in the face with comfort, when Death comes to ſtare him in the face? when he ſhall have a ſentence of Death paſt upon him? What would you then deſire above all the things in this World? what? not a great Eſtate; not this and that that you can think of in the World; but Oh that I might have the Favour of God! and that I might know that God is well pleaſed with me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then a Man or Woman may look Death in the face, and may draw near to God with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Boldneſs; as I remember <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he had the ſentence of death upon him, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>Remember how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> He could appeal to God, that his ways were pleaſing to him, and now he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up his Soul to him, though he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that he had not finiſhed the Work that he had to do in the World; and ſo he could have deſired to live longer; and upon his prayer the Lord did reverſe the ſentence of Death that was upon him; yet when he had the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſee how he took it, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart;</hi> that is, the things that he had been doing, had been pleaſing to the Lord: So a Man or Woman whoſe ways plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God whilſt he lived in the World, when he comes to die he may look Death in the face with comfort. What a deſirable thing then is it for a man or woman to pleaſe God in what he doth? That is the Second thing propounded,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:151103:54"/> That to pleaſe God is a moſt Deſirable thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But in the Third place, you will, ſay, what is that Faith whereby a man or woman comes to pleaſe God?</p>
            <p>Truly it is Faith that is the principle, and ground, and Foundation, whence a man, and his Works, and Services, and Performances come to be pleaſing to God. A Man or Woman may be diligent in the performance of Duties and Services, and yet God may not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them: As for example, take two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that come and joyn together in prayer, they pray the ſame Prayer, or two Perſons that give Alms, they perform the very ſame Duty, the one gives as much alms as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet what the one doth may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, and pleaſing to him, and the other not; whence comes the difference? One doth it in Faith, and the other not. <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> brought their offerings to God, God had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offering, and God had not reſpect to <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering; what was the ground of the difference? ſaies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>By Faith Abel offered a more acceptable Sacrifice than Cain.</hi> Well, but what Faith is it then whereby a Soul, and his Duties, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices come to be pleaſing unto God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Brethren, do not miſtake your ſelves, it is not that Faith whereby a man or Woman gives his conſent to, and believes all that is written in the Scriptures, all that is revealed in the Goſpel concerning Chriſt; a man or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151103:55"/> woman may believe all this, and yet this is not the Faith whereby he comes to be accepted; as you know, the Devils believe all this, and yet are not accepted; So a man or Woman may believe all that is revealed in the Goſpel, and yet never pleaſe God. But what Faith is it whereby a Man, and his Duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances come to pleaſe God? and without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God? Briefly, there is a three-fold Faith required, for the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a mans ſervices and performances with God, that God may be pleaſed with them. Mind it, I pray, for it is a thing of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and poſſibly that which very few have conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, There is required ſaving Faith in Chriſt, that which we call juſtifying Faith; ſuch a believing in Chriſt whereby a Soul comes to be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the Soul; whereby Chriſt becomes the life of the Soul, the very principle of Life in the Soul; a juſtifying ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith in the habit, the principle of Faith, the grace of Faith infuſed into the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Soul comes really to be united to Chriſt, and have an Intereſt in him; to be in Chriſt, as you know the Scripture frequently ſpeaks; I ſhall not ſtand to give you Scriptures for that; you ſee, Brethren, here, how <hi>Abel</hi> and how <hi>Enoch</hi> came to pleaſe God, it was by Faith. What Faith? It was this true Juſtifying Faith, this Faith in Chriſt that was to come; for it was by their Faith in Chriſt that they came to be accepted, and their Offering was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151103:55"/> and pleaſing unto God; by Faith <hi>Abel</hi> was accepted, and his Offering and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was accepted: <hi>Cain</hi> he offered his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but it was not accepted, becauſe he had not this juſtifying Faith. <hi>Enoch</hi> he pleaſed God, and whence was it? It was by his Faith; and ſaies the Apoſtle thereupon, <hi>he had his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he pleaſed God;</hi> it was by his Faith, his juſtifying Faith in Chriſt, whereby he came to be accepted; his perſon was accepted of God, and conſequently his ſervices came to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God; a man or woman muſt firſt have a principle of Life, before he can live a Spiritual Life; now Chriſt is a Chriſtians life, and how comes Chriſt to be the Life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? Namely, by his Faith, when he comes to believe in Chriſt, then Chriſt is his Life, the principle of his life; the Spirit of Chriſt now is in the Soul: that is a plain word, which the Apoſtle hath, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And ſaies Chriſt, in <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>As the branch cannot bring forth Fruit of it ſelf except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. And without me</hi> (mark) <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is pleaſing to God; the word <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me,</hi> holds forth, not ſo much without Strength from Chriſt, though that is true too; but the word ſignifies properly in the Original, without me, that is ſeparated from me, not united to me; that is the word in the <hi>Greek,</hi> juſt as when a Branch is cut off from the Vine, the Branch cannot bring forth Fruit without

Let every Man be fully perſwaded in his own mind, if he do venture to eat any kind of Meats, let him be fully and clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own mind that he may do it, and then he eats in Faith; and if he do not obſerve thoſe days, if he be fully perſwaded in his own mind, then he doth it in Faith; in the two laſt <hi>Verſes</hi> he calls this Faith. <hi>Haſt thou Faith? Have it to thy ſelf before God. Haſt thou Faith?</hi> that is, haſt thou a perſwaſion that it is lawful for thee to eat any kind of meats, or it is Lawful for thee to forbear the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe Days? <hi>Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf.</hi> But mark, <hi>Happy is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not himſelf in that thing that he alloweth, and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith. He that doubteth,</hi> that is, he that queſtioneth whether it be lawful for him to eat this kind of meat or no; he that doubteth whether he ſhall do well to obſerve this day or no; <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith.</hi> That is, he is not fully perſwaded in his own mind; for whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin, whatſoever is not of that perſwaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151103:56"/> to the Will of God, if he do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that perſwaſion, then it is not of Faith, and ſo is a damnable ſin; though the thing be Lawful in it ſelf, yet if he doth the ſame thing doubtingly, it is a damnable ſin that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; without this Faith, this perſwaſion in his Mind, that what he doth is according to the Will of God: and this Faith is requiſite to the pleaſing of God. So here in the inſtance before us in <hi>Abel,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Enoch; Abel</hi> pleaſed God by offering up a Sacrifice, he had this Faith, not only a Juſtifying Faith, but he had this Faith, he was perſwaded that what he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up in Sacrifice, was according to the Will of God; and ſo <hi>Enoch</hi> he walked with God, and had this Teſtimony, <hi>that he pleaſed God;</hi> that in the courſe of his Liſe, the ſteps of his Life was according to the Will of God; he walked with God; the actions that he did he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded was according to the Will of God, and thus he pleaſed God, and this is a Second Faith that is required to the pleaſing of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. There is another Faith that is required further to the pleaſing of God, without which, though I be a Believer, and have a juſtifying Faith, and though I be perſwaded that what I do is according to the Will of God, yet I may not pleaſe God in what I do, except there be another Faith, which is this, Namely, an actual Exerciſe of the principle and habit of Faith in the Duties that we perform; all our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt be done with an act of Faith; it is not ſufficient that a man or woman be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151103:57"/> and do go about this thing and that thing, and run away with this Notion, that he pleaſes God in what he doth; but it is required that he muſt actually exerciſe Faith in what he doth. As for example, for Prayer, a man or woman that is a believer goes to prayer, and he is perſwaded in his conſcience that what he prays for is according to the Will of God, but this is not enough; but if his prayer pleaſe God, he muſt put forth a freſh act of Faith in his Prayer; what he asks for he muſt ask in Faith; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in Prayer,</hi> believing, ſaies Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall receive,</hi> Tho' a man be a believer yet he muſt believe ſtil and in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>If any man lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of God, &amp;c. But let him ask it in Faith;</hi> though he be a believer, yet let him ask in Faith, for if he ask without acting his Faith it is nothing, it is not pleaſing to God; he muſt act Faith in his Prayer: and ſo for hearing the Word, a believer comes to hear the Word, and what he hears he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it is according to the Will of God; well, but is this enough? no, he muſt act Faith in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, or elſe it will be unprofitable to him; ſaies the Apoſtle, in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4.2. <hi>The word Preached did not profit them, not being mixt with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> There muſt be an act of Faith in hearing the Word; we muſt mix Faith in hearing the Word, we muſt act Faith in all our duties &amp; performances. So far as we are wanting in acting &amp; exerciſing of Faith in what we do (the Lord help us to mind theſe things) ſo far forth our Services are defective
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151103:57"/> in pleaſing of God; and ſo I might inſtance in other things, as in giving of Alms, and other things; and ſo, if you obſerve it, <hi>Abel</hi> was not only a Believer, and had the Faith alſo of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that what he did offer was according to the Will of God, ay, but <hi>Abel</hi> went further alſo, when he pleaſed God in his Sacrifices; in all his Sacrifices that he offered up, he did act Faith; and ſo by his acting of Faith, being a believer, his Offerings and Sacrifices were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; and <hi>Enoch,</hi> our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before us, he was a believer, and was perſwaded that what he did was according to to the mind of God; but he walked with God, that is, he did act Faith in all his ſervices that he did, in the ſteps of his Walking. He pleaſed God in his Walking, which muſt be by Faith, by acting of Faith in his Duties and Services, and walking with God, by that means he came to pleaſe God. It is not enough, Brethren, that I have a principle of Faith in me, that I do believe in Chriſt, and that what I do I am perſwaded is according to the Will of God, this is not enough to pleaſe God in the Duties and Services that I perform; but I muſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in the duties and ſervices that God requires of me. Says the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 7.2, 20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> How did he know that? ſaies he, <hi>Chriſt lives in me:</hi> there was a principle of Life; and ſaies he, <hi>the life that I live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God. Paul</hi> had not only Chriſt in him as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151103:58"/> a principle of Life, but <hi>Paul</hi> did alſo act from that principle of Life; <hi>The Life that I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> As for example, a natural man that hath a Soul in his Body, hath a principle of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life; but this is not enough; but now to every natural action of Life that he puts forth, there muſt be an influence from that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Life, or elſe he cannot act; ſo though Chriſt be a principle of ſpiritual life in us, yet notwithſtanding a Man or Woman muſt act ſpiritually, he muſt derive Strength, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and influence from Chriſt, to every duty and ſervice that he performs, to make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; it is not elſe a Spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This is now the Faith that is required in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man and Woman in the World that would pleaſe God; and without this Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. I pray mind it, though I cannot come to the Application now, yet remember it, and obſerve it, poſſibly you may think your ſelves what may be reduced from it; I ſay, without this Faith it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible to pleaſe God: but now with this Faith, though our performances and ſervices be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, yet we come to pleaſe God in doing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, how ſhall we be ſure of that, that whatſoever I do, being a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and acting Faith in it; how may I be ſure
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151103:58"/> that I pleaſe God in what I do? poſſibly here may be a great Temptation that ſome may be exerciſed with; Whether may I venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and be perſwaded in my Soul that I pleaſe God in what I do, acting and exerciſing Faith in it? ſhall I ſpeak briefly to that which is the 4th. thing propounded, Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4th. That by Faith (though a Man or Woman have many failings) yet by Faith they do pleaſe God, though it be impoſſible without Faith to pleaſe him. How doth this appear? briefly in three or four words:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the example of all the believers that ever have been in the World; all the faithful that have been in the World have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God by their Faith; there was never any one Believer in the World that did act Faith, but did pleaſe God in it; and if ſo, then we may be confident of it, that it is a ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing, that by Faith we come to pleaſe God. Look into the Catalogue of Believers, the Faithful in all Ages, read over the 11th of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at your leaſure, and you ſhall ſee that all of them did pleaſe God by their Faith. <hi>Abel</hi> he pleaſed God by his Faith, <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God by Faith, and <hi>Noah</hi> pleaſed God by Faith, theſe were before the flood; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith pleaſed God, for he was the Friend of God; <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were faithful, and they pleaſed God; they might have their failings, and infirmities, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as <hi>Noah</hi> had, he was overtaken with drinking of Wine; and ſo the reſt had their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151103:59"/> weakneſſes; but for all that, they pleaſed God by their Faith, God overlook't their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; and <hi>Abraham</hi> though he was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, yet he had ſometimes a tang of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; as when he went a great while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Son; but yet God overlookt that, and he was pleaſed with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtill. So by Faith <hi>Sarah</hi> conceived, it pleaſed God to give her conception when ſhe was 90 Years old; ſhe had her infirmities and weakneſſes, ſhe told a Lye in the hearing of the Angel; but yet for all that ſhe pleaſed God; and ſo I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in others <hi>David</hi> pleaſed God; by Faith; <hi>David</hi> had his failings, and did ſometimes diſpleaſe God; but yet by his Faith he did pleaſe God: And ſo look upon all thoſe that have been believers, by their acting and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of of Faith, they have all of them come to pleaſe God; and therefore we may take it up for a general concluſion, and may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it, that by Faith we ſhall pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Holy-Ghoſt doth teſtifie in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture again and again, that a man or woman by Faith doth live; What Life? not a natural, but a Spiritual life. Now to live, is not only to have the life of Juſtification, and the life of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but to live, is to have the favour of God, to have God pleaſed with a perſon, that is to live; ſaies <hi>Abraham</hi> to God in the 17th of <hi>Geneſis, Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy Sight;</hi> what did he mean by that? what, that his Life might be lengthned out? No, but that he might find favour in thy Sight; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151103:59"/> ſaies the Prophet, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>In thy favour is life.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.55. <hi>Hearken unto me, and your Soul ſhall live;</hi> that is, you ſhall pleaſe God, and be accepted of God. Now then, this is frequent in Scripture, that all that are Believers do live: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> both the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> bear witneſs to it; the ſame thing is in the <hi>Old-Teſtament, Habakkuk</hi> 2.4. and repeated again in the new, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.38. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> therefore it is out of doubt and Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, By Faith a Soul comes to have the guilt of ſin taken away; I pray, what is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man or Woman doth diſpleaſe God? Namely, by his Sin; guilt doth diſpleaſe God. Now then, Faith is a means and inſtrument to take away that which is diſpleaſing to God, to take away the guilt of Sin. In <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. ſaies <hi>Peter</hi> there to <hi>Cornelius, To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name, whoſoever beleiveth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And ſo in Chapter 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you, therefore, men and Brethren, that through this man is preached unto you forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that beleived are juſtified from all things from which ye could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law of Moſes.</hi> By believing on him, we come to receive remiſſion of ſins. And ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>That they might receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified through Faith which is in me.</hi> Now then, if ſo be that all believers, all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151103:60"/> that have Faith in Chriſt, and do exerciſe their Faith in Chriſt, be juſtified from the guilt of ſin, then they are freed from all that makes them diſpleaſing to God; then by Faith they come to pleaſe God, becauſe by Faith the guilt of ſin is removed, which is the matter of Gods diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly and Laſtly, to have done: By Faith a Man or Woman comes to pleaſe God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Faith, now, the very heart, which is a fountain of uncleanneſs, comes to be made clean; this is the only way to have our hearts purified and cleanſed: <hi>Purifying their hearts by Faith,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. ſo in 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.5. ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>Out of a pure Heart, and a good Conſcience, and Faith unfeigned.</hi> Faith unfeigned is the means whereby the Conſcience and the Heart is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; and truly hence it is that believers are called clean; all that have Faith in Chriſt, and do exerciſe their Faith in Chriſt, they are all pure, and every thing is clean to them, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure all things are pure;</hi> Who doth he mean by pure? mark now by the contrary, <hi>But unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but their very conſcince is defiled.</hi> By Faith now, a mans heart comes to be pure, which is the Fountain of all his actions, all that he performs and does, it muſt come from the Heart; if the heart be clean, if the Fountain be clean, then the water that flows from the Fountain is clean: ſo now, the Heart being purified by Faith, now the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151103:60"/> come to be pure in the ſight of God, through Chriſt. <hi>To a believer every thing is pure,</hi> all that he meddles with and undertakes, if he doth act Faith in it, he pleaſeth God: So now, you have ſeen the 4th thing opened, how we may be ſure that by Faith we come to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Now there is a further queſtion remaining, But may not a Man or Woman pleaſe God without Faith, by doing the thing that God hath commanded? as now to pray, and perform duties, to walk uprightly, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> As the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the World do think that this is the way and means to pleaſe God. I do not deny but we ſhould do thoſe things, and the things themſelves as to the ſubſtance of them, are pleaſing to God; but yet ſtill, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> How that appears, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be ſpoken to in the next place, and then come to the Application.</p>

            <p>YOU have heard the dependance of theſe Words upon the foregoing; we came directly to open the Propoſition as it lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. That without Faith it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman alive ever to pleaſe God.</hi> We have ſhewn you firſt what it is for a Man or Woman to pleaſe God. Secondly, we have proved to you, that this pleaſing of God is a matter of very great concernment; it is a thing very deſirable for a Man or Woman to be found pleaſing God. And then in the third place, we came to enquire what Faith that is without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. And then fourthly, we came to clear it up to you, that by Faith a Soul doth pleaſe God. Thus far we have gone.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now we come in the fifth place to give
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151103:62"/> you ſome demonſtrations, to make it evident to you (if the Lord pleaſe to ſet in with it) that it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman ever to pleaſe God without Faith: It is not only ſaid here, that without Faith a man hath not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, or without Faith no man ever ſhall pleaſe God, but he ſpeaks a greater word, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> This is ſuch a thing, that it will hardly enter into the hearts of men and women to be perſwaded of it. What! not pleaſe God by doing what God requires! why, if I be diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in my calling, doth not that pleaſe God! if I perform the Duties that God requires doth not that pleaſe God! if I give much in a way of charity, perform good works, and be given to Alms-deeds in relieving the poor Saints of Chriſt, is not this pleaſing unto God! if I ſuffer for the Truths ſake, doth not this pleaſe God! why, do but obſerve and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And conſider alſo what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. ſays he, <hi>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, yet all is nothing without charity;</hi> without Love: and whence comes this Love, but from Faith? it is Faith that worketh Love. Now if the Apoſtle ſay, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God without Faith, then certainly this is a Truth, whether we can believe it or no; it is a Truth notwithſtanding all that can be objected againſt it. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, mark the word, when he ſaies impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151103:63"/> he doth not mean, that it is a very hard and difficult thing, that which may come to paſs with a great deal of difficulty, as ſometimes that is meant by impoſſible in Scripture-phraſe, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.27. ſays Chriſt to them, <hi>With men it is impoſſible.</hi> Impoſſible, that is, very hard, very difficult; but now to pleaſe God without Faith, is not only impoſſible with ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, but it is impoſſible ſo as it oppoſes God in his determinate Counſel, <hi>Without faith it is abſolutely impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> Such an impoſſibility as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once inlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance:</hi> It is abſolutely impoſſible, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Gods determination. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>It is impoſſible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away ſin:</hi> It is impoſſible that all the blood of all the creatures under Heaven ſhould take away the guilt of ſin. So here, without Faith it is impoſſible for a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to pleaſe God, abſolutely impoſſible. Let me now give you two or three demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make it evident and apparent in every mans Conſcience, I hope, through the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Spirit of God: And O that the Lord would perſwade us of the truth of this, That it is impoſſible to pleaſe God without Faith.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe all that ever an unbelieving man or woman doth or can do, is all for ſelf, and not for God; and is it poſſible then to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151103:63"/> pleaſe God, when he does nothing at all, not one thing for God, but all for ſelf, every thing for ſelf? every duty that he performs is all for ſelf; every unbeliever is juſt <hi>Judas</hi> like, in <hi>John</hi> 12.6. <hi>Judas</hi> was a Thief, and had the Bag, and bare what was put therein; he had Chriſts Bag, and the Diſciples Bag, ay, but he had another Bag of his own; ſo every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath a Bag, he ſeems to have a Bag for God and for Chriſt, but he hath a Bag for ſelf, and he puts all into that Bag: He may ſeem to do a great deal for God, he may pray much, and frequently and earneſtly; he may read the Word very much, and attend very often upon the Word Preached, he may be frequent in the ordinary duties of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God, nay, let me ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he may be taken up in extraordinary duties too, as Faſting, and Prayer, and the like, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t ſtill all for ſelf, and nothing at all for God. Look into <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6. ſaith the Lord there, <hi>Speak unto all the people of the Land, and to the Prieſts, ſaying, when ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh month, even thoſe ſeventy years, did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat for your ſelves, and drink for your ſelves?</hi> All for ſelf. Thus it is with every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, whatever he doth he doth for ſelf, he is compaſſed about in the Circle of ſelf, and cannot get a hairs breadth beyond it; and do you think that we can pleaſe God in any duty or ſervice that we perform, when the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151103:64"/> Lord ſees and knows that we do all for ſelf? do you think that God can accept of that Service? Make it your own caſe, ſuppoſe now you had a Servant, you give him Meat, and Drink, and Wages, and he Works, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Toyls, but all is for himſelf; now, though he labour and work, yet is it pleaſing to you? is it acceptable to you? Or ſuppoſe you have a Factor, and you ſend him to Trade for you, you truſt him with your Stock, and he is diligent in his Trade, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his buſineſs, but all his Trade is for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would you accept of this? is this pleaſing to you? no, you will ſay, he is a very unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wretched Servant, and you cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him. Why, this is the very caſe, God hath ſent us into the World to Trade for him, and to act for him, now all that ever we do whilſt we are in a ſtate of unbelief, is for ſelf; we do every thing for ſelf; truly, until <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Soul comes to believe on Chriſt, all that he doth is for himſelf, he cannot get out of the circle of ſelf; but now, when a Soul comes to receive Chriſt by Faith, then he comes to act for Chriſt, and to deny ſelf, never can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf before; as it was with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> before his Converſion he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, but yet all was for ſelf; he was very zealous for the Law, and he was very upright, but all was for ſelf; but now when he comes to believe on Chriſt, ſelf is laid aſide, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I am nothing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Though I be nothing; Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151103:64"/> Saint of Chriſt, and yet he is nothing! <hi>Now,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I am nothing, I can do nothing, I cannot pray, I know not how to pray, nor do no-nothing as I ought to do it; I cannot ſo much as think a good thought,</hi> ſaies he; now ſelf is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſelf is put down; but now, mark, Chriſt is lifted up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than they all, yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me; not I, ſaies he, but the grace of God with me, or in me;</hi> ſo ſaies he in <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>I know how to abound, and how to want; I have learned in all ſtates and conditions therewith to be content; I can do all things,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> Thus, when he comes to believe, he exalts Chriſt, and abaſes ſelf; Faith is a ſelf-emptying Grace, it makes the Soul to be little or nothing, and makes Chriſt to be all; it hath no ſtrength in its ſelf, but doth all in the ſtrength of Chriſt; and till the Soul comes to believe on Chriſt, ſelf is the cheif agent in all that he doth, and therefore now it is impoſſible for a man or woman ever to pleaſe God, by all that he can do, till he comes to believe. You know what is ſaid in the parable of the Talents, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. He that had one Talent, and improved it not, but hid it, he came and brought his Talent; but did he pleaſe his Lord with the Talent? He had not improved his Talent for his Lord; and ſaies his Lord to him, <hi>Thou wicked and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, take away the Talent from him.</hi> Now what would his Lord have ſaid to him if he had improved it for himſelf? he did not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:151103:65"/> improve it for his Lord nor for himſelf neither, and was this diſpleaſing to his Lord? how much more diſpleaſing would it have been if he had improved it for himſelf? Certainly, whatever a man or woman doth, if he do it not for God, but for himſelf, he cannot pleaſe God in it: Then a man cannot pleaſe God without Faith, becauſe without Faith he cannot go beyond ſelf. <hi>Ephraim is an empty Vine, he bringeth forth Fruit to himſelf, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> 10.1. And ſo God ſpeaks of every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, ſuch a man or woman is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit to himſelf; he doth not, he cannot pleaſe God in any thing that he doth; This is the firſt demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> becauſe till a man or womans perſon be accepted and pleaſing to God, all that ever he doth cannot pleaſe God; and that cannot be without Faith. It is ſaid in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 4.4, 5. that God had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> and to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, he had not reſpect to <hi>Cain</hi> and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but he had reſpect to <hi>Abel's</hi> Sacrifice. why? becauſe he had firſt reſpect to <hi>Abels</hi> perſon. By Faith his perſon was accepted, and then his Sacrifice was accepted; God had no reſpect to <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice, becauſe his perſon was not accepted; and his perſon was not accepted, becauſe he was not a Believer. When a Soul comes to believe on Chriſt, then, and not till then his perſon is accepted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which made God diſpleaſed with him is removed, and his Sin is pardoned, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151103:65"/> now the Soul doth appear Righteous in the ſight of God; but till a perſon comes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt, it is impoſſible that ever this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould pleaſe God; becauſe his perſon is not accepted, then whatever comes from him is not accepted. It is a full word that the Apoſtle hath to this purpoſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>So then</hi> (he brings it in by way of concluſion) <hi>So then, they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That are in the fleſh, you will ſay, what is that? was not <hi>Paul</hi> in the Fleſh? when he ſaies in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life that I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God? Paul</hi> was in the Fleſh, and did not <hi>Paul</hi> pleaſe God? all the believers that are upon the face of the Earth are in the Fleſh, and yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaies here, <hi>thoſe that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God:</hi> But I pray obſerve, what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle means by being in the fleſh, there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptation of the Word, one is to live this life here in the Body, but that is not the Apoſtles meaning, when he ſays <hi>thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> for then never a Believer in the World can pleaſe God. But then 2dly, there is another meaning of the Word, according to the Scripture; to be in the fleſh, is to be in a fleſhly carnal State, a corrupt State, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed State, an unbelieving State and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they that are thus in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God; and this is the ſence of the Holy-Ghoſt in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For when we were in the Fleſh,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why, he was in the Fleſh in one ſence, but he was not in the Fleſh in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence; <hi>when we were in the Fleſh,</hi> that is,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151103:66"/> when we were unbelievers, in a fleſhly carnal ſtate, when we were ſo in the fleſh, we could not pleaſe God, and no man that is in the Fleſh in that ſence can pleaſe God. But why is it not poſſible for a man or woman that is an Unbeliever to pleaſe God? Why ſo? why, look but into the former verſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. there he gives you the reaſon of it, why thoſe that are Unbelievers cannot pleaſe God; becauſe <hi>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God,</hi> it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nether indeed can be; and then he brings in this concluſion, <hi>So then they that are in the Fleſh,</hi> they that have a carnal mind, they that are altogther unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>cannot pleaſe God;</hi> becauſe they are Enemies to God, enemies in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for mark the expreſſion, he doth not ſay the carnal mind is an enemy to God, but he puts it in the abſtract, <hi>the Carnal mind is enmity againſt God;</hi> Enmity it ſelf; it is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to God, it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, till God change it. Now ſee the force of the demonſtration, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unbeliever is an Enemy to God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing he doth comes from a principle of enmity againſt God; and do you think that can pleaſe God? though he ſeems to do much for God, he prays much, and reads much, and is much in thankſgiving, and much in confeſſing of ſin, but all this comes from a principle of enmity againſt God, and what can this pleaſe God? Suppoſe now you ſhould have an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and he ſhould come and ſeem to ſpeak you fair, and you know that he hath a heart full of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:151103:66"/> hatred and enmity againſt you; poſſibly; he comes and confeſſes he hath done you wrong, and he is ſorry for it, but he hopes he ſhall do ſo no more; if you know he comes and ſpeaks this with a ſpirit of Enmity, and that he doth maintain his enmity as fully in his heart and mind as ever, are you pleaſed with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions? no, you abhor him the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he comes in a diſſembling hipocritical way. Now, God ſees and knows our Hearts, poſſibly we may be taken with ſome ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of an enemy, and think he means as he ſays, and take it in good part; but a Man cannot deceive God. So when an Unbeliever comes and confeſſes his Sins to God, the Lord ſees he doth it with a ſpirit of enmity, he comes with his humble petitions and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Heart is full of Enmity and hatred againſt God; Will the Lord now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this? He comes and gives thanks to God, but the Lord looks upon all as hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and flattering; and can this be pleaſing to God? in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.34 <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God.</hi> Verſe 35. <hi>And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that God was their Rock, and the High God their Redeemer.</hi> Now, they challenge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, and claim intereſt in God; well, but what doth the Holy-Ghoſt ſay of this their inquiring after God? Verſe 36. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they Flattered him with their Mouth, and they Lyed unto him with their Tongues.</hi> And could God be pleaſed with this? I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, this is the very caſe, every Unbeliever is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151103:67"/> an Enemy to God, is in a State of enmity till ſuch time as he comes to believe on Chriſt; then indeed the enmity is taken away, but till he come to believe on Chriſt, he is an enemy to God, and he hates God in his Soul, and whatever he doth he doth but diſſemble; if he comes and confeſs his ſins, and give thanks to God, and make petitions and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God, all this doth not pleaſe God, he doth but Flatter, and play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and Lye to God; to his Face. How then can a Man or Woman pleaſe God without Faith? that is the Second demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Take one more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> why? becauſe all that ever a man or Woman doth that is an unbeliever; is all but dead works, all is Stinking, Dead; a dead Service, and a dead Sacrifice, whatever he brings to God, it is dead, his Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are dead, and his Supplications and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are all dead, his Reading and Hearing the Word is all dead, all that he doth is dead. Now, do you think that the living God can or will be pleaſed with dead ſervices? can this be pleaſing to him? all is dead, becauſe it comes from a dead principle, every unbelieving man and woman in the World is ſpiritually dead, and therefore all that comes from him muſt be dead; they are all dead works, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls them, in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 6.1. <hi>Leaving the Principles of Repentance from dead works,</hi> ſaies he, and ſo in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151103:67"/> Spirit offered up himſelf to God without ſpot, purge your Concience from dead works, &amp;c.</hi> when the Blood of Chriſt comes to be ſprinkled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul by Faith, then he is cleanſed from dead works; but before, all is dead, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his calling, his thankſgivings, his prayers, and all, is dead, and how can this pleaſe a living God? Can a man gather Grapes of Thorns, and Figs of Thiſtles? No. So, can any thing that is lively and acceptable to God, come from a dead Heart? No. Can God be pleaſed with that which is dead? that which is dead is diſpleaſing to you; if they give you dead Drink, dead Beer, or dead Wine, doth it pleaſe you? No, you will ſay you had rather drink Water. All the ſervices that an unbeliever can perform, they are all but dead in the ſavour of God, they are all ſtinking, loathſome things, therefore how can theſe things be pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? This is the ſtate of every unbeliever, he is ſpiritually dead, and all that he doth is dead, nothing that is living or lively can come from a dead thing; a dead thing cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a living action; but now, by Faith, a ſoul comes to be made alive; when a ſoul comes to receive Chriſt he receives a principle of Life; but every unbeliever is dead, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he does can be pleaſing unto God. So now you have heard the point demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, That it is impoſſible for any man or woman to pleaſe God without Faith. We come now in the next place for the further clearing this truth, and for your more diſtinct underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151103:68"/> of it, to remove ſome objections that poſſibly may be made againſt it; As firſt, what is nothing pleaſing to God without Faith? You will ſay, did not the Elect pleaſe God from all Eternity? did not God chuſe the Elect, and ſet his love upon them? did not they pleaſe God? yet they had no Faith: then it ſeems it is poſſible to pleaſe God without Faith. Indeed, if the <hi>Arminians</hi> were to anſwer this, they would eaſily anſwer it; for they make electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be upon foreſeen Faith, that God did foreſee that ſuch and ſuch a man would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and therefore he elected him; and if ſo, then the elect cannot pleaſe God without Faith; but we do not joyn with them in that thing, there was not any thing foreſeen that did move God to elect one or another. In <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 9.11. the Apoſtle there, inſtances in the two Children, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, For the Children being not yet born, having done neither good nor evil, God did not conſider them as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God, according to election might ſtand, not of Works but of him that calleth: It was ſaid unto her the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger.</hi> God doth not conſider that in point of election, for election is not the effect of Faith foreſeen, but Faith is the conſequent of Election; he hath choſen us, that we ſhould be Holy, that we ſhould believe, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>And as many as were Ordained to Eternal Life, believed.</hi> Election is antecedent to Faith and believing; God was not pleaſed with the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151103:68"/> Elect, becauſe of their Faith; no, but they were choſen to Faith: and then, did not they pleaſe God without Faith? there is the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer ſhortly, That the Elect did not pleaſe God, but God was pleaſed out of his free Grace to ſet his Love of Benevolence upon them, and thereby did intend in time to ſhew Love and Friendſhip to them; I ſay, it was not becauſe they pleaſed God, that God choſe them, and elected them; but God was pleaſed out of his infinite free Grace and Love to ordain them in time, to manifeſt his love of friendſhip to them; ſo that it was not for Faith nor without Faith, for they did not pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But then you will ſay, Did not <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency pleaſe God? if he did, then it is poſſible to pleaſe God without Faith, for <hi>Adam</hi> had no Faith in innocency. Now, before the fall <hi>Adam</hi> did pleaſe God; was there not a ſweet intercourſe between God and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> was there not a covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and <hi>Adam?</hi> Did not God come and ſpeak in a familiar way to <hi>Adam?</hi> Surely <hi>Adam</hi> pleaſed God, <hi>Adam</hi> had not Faith; then it is poſſible to pleaſe God without Faith. For Anſwer to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In a word, <hi>Adam</hi> had a Faith, though not ſuch a Faith as believers have now, yet <hi>Adam</hi> had a faith of Affiance, of Truſt and Confidence, and Dependance upon God, which was required in the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and <hi>Adam</hi> had all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151103:69"/> of the Law written upon his Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Truth doth preſuppoſe man in a ſinful fallen ſtate, <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, and ſo all the poſterity of <hi>Adam;</hi> now, there is no Son nor Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> ſince the Fall that can ever pleaſe God without Faith; <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf ſince the fall, if ever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God it was by Faith, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe that are ſuppoſed to be Sinners and Enemies againſt God, That <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible for them to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, Have not ſome that have been unbelievers, by doing of thoſe things that God hath required, pleaſed God? Look into the example of <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. You know that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Jehu</hi> to go and cut off all the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that was his Meſſage; that he ſhould deſtroy all the poſterity of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and ſo be did, in <hi>Chapt.</hi> 9. and the fore-part of the 10th <hi>Chapter.</hi> Now then, ſee what a Teſtimony the Lord gives of his own approbation of <hi>Jehu</hi> at the 30 <hi>verſe, And the Lord ſaid to Jehu, Becauſe thou haſt done well in Executing that which is right in mine Eyes, and haſt done unto the Houſe of Ahab according to all that was in mine Heart; thy Children of the Fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſit on the Throne of Iſrael.</hi> Did not <hi>Jehu</hi> pleaſe God here? and was not <hi>Jehu</hi> an Unbeliever? ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 31. <hi>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart, for he departed not from the ſins of Jeroboam, which made Iſrael to Sin.</hi> And
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151103:69"/> ſo for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he did what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to do. Go, ſays God, <hi>againſt Tyrus, and conquer it,</hi> it coſt him a hard bout, but did it not pleaſe God? Then it ſeems when men and women do that which God requires, they pleaſe God in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Anſwer to this in two things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> That the thing that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands being done do pleaſe God for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, for the matter of it, it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and ſo far pleaſing, as God may manifeſt his Approbation; he may give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he doth approve of it, by ſome outward reward, as he did to <hi>Jehu;</hi> God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that what he did pleaſed him, and he gave him a reward. And ſo for <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Warring againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> God did approve of it, and ſhew his acceptation of the thing, being done, by rewarding and recompenſing of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Ezekiel</hi> 29.18, 19. and 20. <hi>Son of Man, Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon: hath cauſed his Army to ſerve a great Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tyrus, &amp;c.</hi> And what ſhall he have? he ſhall have a reward; <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, I will give the Land of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, &amp;c.</hi> That is one Anſwer, That the thing that God Commands, being done, God doth approve of it for the Subſtance. But,</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though God do approve of the thing that is done for the ſubſtance of it, yet being done by ſuch a perſon, in ſuch a manner, to ſuch an end, God doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151103:70"/> it. As now, take both theſe Inſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Jehu,</hi> God did approve of the thing that he did, and manifeſted his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; his cutting off the poſterity of <hi>Ahab,</hi> God approved of it; but for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Jehu's</hi> doing of it, it being done in the way of unbelief, God expreſſes his diſpleaſure againſt it, in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.4. ſaies God, <hi>yet a little while, and I will avenge the Blood of Jezreel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Houſe of Jehu.</hi> What? would God be revenged for doing that which he required? God Commanded him to cut off the Poſterity of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and God approved of it; but for the manner of doing of it, it being done by ſuch a one in a ſtate of unbelief, he did not pleaſe God in it; the thing it ſelf was acceptable to God; but for the manner of it, God was not pleaſed with it. And ſo for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> God calls him his Servant, in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 25.9. <hi>The break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nations by Nebuchadnezzar was a thing that God required: and yet being done by him, God will be revenged on him for it.</hi> Therefore if you look into <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.22. God threatens there to deſtroy <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Kingdom that had deſtroyed ſo many Nations; and yet he had done but that that God had ſet him about; ſo that obſerve, and underſtand the Anſwer thus, that the thing done that God requires, for the ſubſtance of it, God doth allow and approve of it: but being done by one that is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, God doth not accept of his perſon nor of his Service, God may allow it ſo far as to manifeſt his approbation of it, and to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151103:70"/> give ſome outward recompence and reward for it, and yet notwithſtanding God doth not allow it, ſo as to accept it with a Gracious acceptation, being done by ſuch a one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But the Fourth Objection is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Weight and Moment, and a matter of the greateſt Temptation, and that is this; you will ſay to me, But if it be impoſſible for a Man or woman to pleaſe God without Faith, then it is in vain for any man or woman to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do any thing that is pleaſing unto God; for if it be impoſſible to pleaſe God by what we do, then why ſhould we pray, and hear the Word, and read the Word? here is a Temptation that I ſuppoſe will preſently come in upon you. If it be impoſſible to pleaſe God without Faith, hath not this a tendency to put people into deſpair of ever hoping to pleaſe God by all that they can do?</p>
            <p>But for Anſwer to it briefly in two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, Though it be true, that it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman to pleaſe God without Faith, yet notwithſtanding, (mark I pray what I ſay) yet God may pleaſe to look towards the prayers and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of an Unbeliever; God may pleaſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to look towards their deſires and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, when they are in the Lords way, ſeeking of him; I do not ſay God will do it, but I ſay God may do it; perhaps God may look towards an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and give ear to the prayers that he makes (I pray mind it:) becauſe here is a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151103:71"/> very great Temptation that is ready ſecretly to prevail over us upon the hearing of ſuch a Truth as this, that we cannot pleaſe God by all that ever we can do. Why, then a Man had as good take his courſe, and Sin, and take his pleaſures in the World, he can but diſpleaſe God at laſt, and he cannot pleaſe him by all that he can do: Therefore, I ſay, here is the firſt Anſwer, Though it is true, we cannot ſay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that God will be pleaſed with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and endeavours of an Unbeliever, yet God may pleaſe graciouſly to look towards the prayers and ſupplications of an unbelieving Soul; I pray elſe, why doth the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> put <hi>Simon Magus</hi> upon it to pray to God, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was a Sorcerer, and he liſtened and hearkened to what <hi>Philip</hi> Preached, and forſooth he would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and went for a Believer; <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> hearing the report what was done by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, went to confirm him; but <hi>Peter</hi> preſently ſmelt out <hi>Simon Magus</hi> what he was, by his offering him Money for the gift of the Holy-Ghoſt: ſaies he, <hi>Thy Money perriſh with thee: I perceive that thou art in the Gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the Bond of iniquity, repent,</hi> ſays he, <hi>therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. Peter</hi> put him upon Prayer, he was a wicked Man, an Unbeliever, in the Gall of bitterneſs, and in the Bond of iniquity, yet pray to God, ſaies he, perhaps the thought of thy Heart may be forgiven thee; And ſo <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:151103:71"/> ſpeaks in 2. <hi>Tim. Ch.</hi> 2. Two laſt Verſes, <hi>In meekneſs, inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will give them Repentance, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth</hi> God may peradventure give them repentance, though it is a certain Truth, that <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Yet thus much I may ſay, to help to take off this objection, That there is a perhaps, if you be found diligent in ſeeking God, and humbling your Souls before the Lord, peradventure you may be forgiven, I do not ſay you ſhall certainly be forgiven; and God will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear you; but perhaps, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> perhaps, and if peradventure, ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> God will give them Repentance; then here is a [perhaps] for thoſe that are Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that God may graciouſly pleaſe to have reſpect towards them, though God be not pleaſed with them not their prayers, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; therefore let not this Temptation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over you upon that account, namely, to give over all, becauſe you cannot pleaſe God by what you do peradventure God may, have reſpect towards you; but now, if you go on, and caſt off ſeeking God, and the ways of God, and go on in your ſinful ways and courſes, there is no perhaps for ſuch, no; but if Men ſin willfully (mark the expreſſion) in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26. If Men ſin wilfully, and caſt off the means of Grace wilfully, there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ſuch: He puts an impoſſibility upon himſelf ever to be recovered therefore, give not way to the Temptation, but ſay, Well,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151103:72"/> there is a peradventure, and perhaps for me, though I be an Unbeliever. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me anſwer it in another thing; Though it be true, that without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God; Nay, though we do diſpleaſe God by all that we do; make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as ſtrong as you can; it is impoſſible to pleaſe God by all my Prayers, Tears, and Confeſſions, in my waitings upon God; yet, notwithſtanding, know and underſtand it for a Truth, that there are degrees of diſpleaſing God; a man may diſpleaſe God more or leſs. Look into <hi>Zachariah</hi> 1.15. <hi>I am very ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Heathen that are at eaſe: for I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped forward the affliction.</hi> God may be ſorely diſpleaſed, and God may be leſs diſpleaſed with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as now, if one ſin doth diſpleaſe God, will not many ſins diſpleaſe him much more? if that which we call a ſmall ſin will diſpleaſe God, then a greater ſin will dipleaſe him much more. So now, if we diſpleaſe God by our Duties and Services, then may we not diſpleaſe God much more by caſting off duties? Nay, may we not diſpleaſe him moſt of all not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by caſting of Duties, but by running deſperately and Headlong into all, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Evil. Mark how you conclude, you cannot pleaſe God by what you do, therefore you will diſpleaſe him more; this is to run headlong and deſperately into the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hell. As there are degrees of glory in Heaven, as one Star differs from another Star
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151103:72"/> in Glory; ſo there are degrees of Torment in Hell. It ſhall be more tollerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gommorah</hi> at the day of Judgement, than for thoſe that have the Goſpel and do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. <hi>As ſhe hath fared deliciouſly,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>ſo much the more Torment give her,</hi> ſaies God, in <hi>Revelations</hi> 18.7. So now, becauſe we do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God by what we do in our duties and ſervices, therefore ſhall we run further on to diſpleaſe God more and more? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſpleaſe God by doing things irregularly and unbelievingly, but ſhall we therefore run headlong upon wickedneſs, and care not how much we diſpleaſe God? O! therefore let us have a care of this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is very great and dangerous; becauſe we cannot pleaſe God by doing what we can, therefore we will run headlong on to diſpleaſe him all that we can: So now I have finiſhed the explication of this Truth, <hi>That without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> I cannot now come to that Application which I chiefly intend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appli.</hi> But in a word, becauſe I would not leave you wholy without ſome word of Application:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Here then, let all thoſe that are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers underſtand and know this day from the Lord, what a dangerous ſtate and condition they are in; it is ſuch a ſtate and condition as is not to be reſted quietly in, becauſe that they cannot poſſibly pleaſe God by all that they can do, I would not ſpeak any thing to diſcourage and caſt down any, but to awaken poor Souls: Underſtand and know this day
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151103:73"/> from the Lord, that you never yet did pleaſe God by all that ever you have done; you have made poſſibly many Hundred prayers and petitions to God, you have been exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in holy Duties and Services all along from day to day; yet you have not pleaſed God in any thing that you have done; Nay, without Faith you cannot pleaſe God in whatever you ſhall do, it is impoſſible. What ſhould I ſay more, read but the Text, ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not only ſpeak of ſuch as live in open known ſins of Uncleanneſs, and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneſs, and Swearing, and Lying, that they do not pleaſe God, that is plain enough; every one will ſay that theſe men do not pleaſe God, and that it is impoſſible they ſhould pleaſe God. And thoſe that live in ſecret Sins, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret covetouſneſs of heart, in ſecret oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſecret omiſion and neglect of duty, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Cloſet-prayer, do theſe things pleaſe God think you? not that I ſpeak to ſuch as theſe are, but to thoſe that are profeſſors, and that are careful to walk ſtrictly and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly in their places, as far as ever they have light and underſtanding; you are careful poſſibly to deal righteouſly in your Callings and Trade, you deſire to make Conſcience of your ways in buying and ſelling, and trading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the World, to walk uprightly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, and what, doth not this pleaſe God, you will ſay? do not I pleaſe God in this? I pray mark, is this Faith or no? The Apoſtle
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:151103:73"/> ſaies here, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> ſuppoſe you perform duties, wait upon God in his Worſhip and Ordinances, are very diligent in attending upon the Word Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and very dilligent in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily, day by day, and you are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent alſo in private duties, ſuch as I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before doth not this pleaſe God, you will ſay? why, I pray ſtill do but have recourſe to the Apoſtles words, <hi>without Faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Can you ſay that theſe things are Faith? <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> But if a Man or Woman be ſo Charitable that they are ready upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to relieve the Bowels of the Saints, doth not this pleaſe God? why, ſaies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Do you believe that this is a Truth that this Text holds forth? our Charity and good works, they are not Faith, and <hi>without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Reckon what you can reckon, and ſay what you can for your ſelves, yet conſider, is this Faith or no? If it be not Faith, it cannot pleaſe God. Poſſibly you may deſire and endeavour to walk in the ſtricteſt way of profeſſion, and worſhip God in the cloſeſt way; ſuppoſe you do ſo, you deſire to walk in Church-fellowſhip with the Saints, but this is not Faith ſtill, and <hi>without Faith is is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> I pray conſider the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> before he was converted, and was brought to believe on Chriſt, in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.5. ſays he, <hi>After the moſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151103:74"/> ſtraiteſt ſect of our Religion, I lived a Phariſee.</hi> And ſays he in another place, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>As concerning the righteouſneſs which is in the law, I was blameleſs,</hi> ſays he at <hi>verſe</hi> 6. But now mark, ſays he, <hi>this was not faith;</hi> though when he comes to believe on Chriſt, <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I look at all that ever I did as nothing, and I count all but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Brethren, whatever we do, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible for us to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But poſſibly you will ſay to me, I hope I do believe: If you do, it is well; But, I pray, do you know what it is to believe? ask this queſtion to your own hearts, Do you know what it is to believe? It is not to believe that every thing that is ſpoken in the Goſpel is true; no, no, this Faith whereby we come to pleaſe God, is another manner of Faith.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe now that you do believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth, I pray have you done all that ever you have done in a way of Faith and believing? truly without Faith you ſee it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; even you that are Believers, without acting of Faith in what you do, you cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay to me then, <hi>How ſhall a Chriſtian man or woman ſo perform duties in Faith, ſo as they may be pleaſing unto God?</hi> As ſuppoſe now the duty of Prayer, How ſhall we perform the duty of prayer, ſo as it may be pleaſing unto God? or for hearing the Word, How ſhall we ſo hear the Word in Faith that it may be pleaſing unto God? and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151103:74"/> how ſhall we partake of the Lords-Table in Faith ſo as to pleaſe God?</p>
            <p>I cannot come to anſwer this now; but poſſibly if the Lord pleaſe, I may ſpeak ſomething to that at ſome other time; all that I have to ſay for the preſent is this:</p>
            <p>You ſee, Friends, Brethren and Beloved, what cauſe we have all of us, I ſpeak not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to unbelievers, but to thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; as for unbelievers, what cauſe have they to go home and bewail and bemoan their condition before the Lord? Look back upon all that you have done throughout your whole lives, and you may write this upon it all, you have diſpleaſed God; you have made many Prayers, and confeſſed many Sins, and given thanks to God often; you have read and heard the Word, and have done this and that, and yet in all that you have done you have never pleaſed God, becauſe <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> Go and bewail it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that you have led ſuch a courſe of life, that you have done nothing that hath been pleaſing unto God. And you that are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, have you done all that you have done in Faith? have you prayed in faith? have you heard the word in faith, and have you partaked in other Ordinances in a way of faith? we have all cauſe to go home, and in private fal down before the Lord, and acknowledge that we have diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in every duty and ſervice that we have performed.</p>

            <p>THe words as you have heard, are an intire Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That without Faith it is impoſſible for any Man or Woman, by all that ever they can do, to pleaſe God.</hi> You have heard it opened at large, we came the laſt day to touch upon a word of Application, and that was to ſhew what a ſad and uncomfortable condition every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving perſon was in; that nothing that ever he hath done, or can do, or ſhall do whilſt he is in this ſtate, can be pleaſing unto God; For <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe Him.</hi> Whatever Duties we perform, whatever Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances we partake in, if all be not done in Faith, it cannot be pleaſing unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay unto me then, <hi>How ſhall we ſo act in Faith in the performance of all Duties,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151103:75"/> and in the partaking of all Ordinances, that ſo we may pleaſe God in what we do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a great Queſtion, and I ſhall deſire through the Lords aſſiſtance to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this at this time. And, O Brethren, this is a matter of very great concernment, to do all that we do in Faith, to pray every Prayer in Faith, and every time we hear the Word, to hear it in Faith; and if we partake of the Lords-Table, every time to partake in Faith; or elſe we do not pleaſe God in any of theſe Duties. Let me therefore a little ſtir you up to it, that you may be provoked, if poſſible, to do all that you do in Faith.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Let me hint <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> words that way, to ſhew you, that it is of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, for every one of us to perform e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Duty, and to partake of every Ordinance, in a way of Faith. For firſt of all, elſe all that ever we do, all our labour, all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, all our pains in our duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, will be all in vain. And would a wiſe man be willing to do any thing in vain? to take pains and all in vain? <hi>Have ye ſuffered ſo many things</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 4.) <hi>in vain?</hi> Truly, ſo may we ſay to thoſe that do not exerciſe Faith in their duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, have you done ſo many things in vain? Would any of you take pains in your Callings willingly in vain, and looſe all your labour? Are you willing that all your labour, and travel, and pains from day to day ſhould be loſt, and all in vain? You would count it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151103:76"/> a very grievous and uncomfortable thing, if any of you ſhould take any great Voyage by Sea, and all your Voyage and Hazard ſhould be in vain? or if you ſhould take any great Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by Land, in heat and cold, in wet and dry, through thick and thin, and all your Journey ſhould be in vain, and nothing at all come of it, what a grief and vexation would it be to your hearts? Now Brethren, I pray Conſider of it, if we perform duties, take pains in duties day by day, perform Duties in our Families, and in our Cloſets every day, preſenting our Prayers and Supplications before the Lord, and frequently in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon atrending upon the Word of God Preached, and go on thus week after week, month after month, and year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter year, labouring and taking pains in your duties, and yet when all comes to all it is all in vain; Truly, thus it will be, if it be not done in Faith; you have prayed ſo many times in a Week, and ſo many times in a year, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a thouſand times in your Life, yet all is in vain; for you ſee you cannot pleaſe God, and therefore it is in vain. You deſire to pleaſe God in your Duties, and in your attendances upon the Lord, but all is in vain; What a ſad and uncomfortable thing is this? Therefore certainly it is of great concernment to look to that, that we do not perform Duties in vain, that we do not Pray, and Read, and Hear without Faith, for then all will be in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider a little further, What an uncomfortable thing is it for a man to meet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151103:76"/> with a diſappointment in his great expectation? When a man hath great expectations of a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and meets with a diſappointment in the concluſion, that his expectation is fruſtrated; you know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, in Prov. 13.12. <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart ſick.</hi> If a man have hopes of a thing, and his hopes be only put off and deferred, though it may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt, yet if it be deferred beyond the time, it makes his heart ſick. Ay, but when a mans expectations be not only deferred, but altogether fruſtrated, that he meets with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſappointments, What an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing is this? and the greater the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a man is, or the greater the thing is his expectation is about the greater, and ſadder will his diſappointment be. You know how it fared with <hi>Haman,</hi> in <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. When the King propounded that Queſtion to him, <hi>What ſhall be done unto the man whom the King delighteth to honour?</hi> Why, thought he, whom the King delights to honour, is none but my ſelf; Surely I am the man: here was his hope and expectation; but now to be fruſtrated of this great expectation of being honoured and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and for the King to ſay, Go take the Kings Horſe, and the Royal apparrel, and go and ſet <hi>Mordecai</hi> thereon (his great Enemy) go and proclaim before him, <hi>thus it ſhall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour;</hi> thus was his expectation fruſtrated, and it came to nothing. And how did it make his heart ſick? He went home to his Wife and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151103:77"/> company, and he was even ſick at the very heart. Truly, Brethren, when a mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations are raiſed from his Duties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, that he hath gone on in a way of Prayer all his Life-long, and attending upon God in the way of his Ordinances all his Life-long, and his expectation is great, he thinks he hath been pleaſing God all his life-long; and when all comes to all, at laſt he ſhall ſee that he wanted Faith, and ſo never pleaſed God in all his Life, by all the Duties and Services that ever he performed. Here now will his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations be fruſtrated; and when he comes to lie upon his Death-bed, he thinks he hath been pleaſing God in performing Duties, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon God in his way, he ſhall meet with nothing but Diſappointments; He hath not pleaſed God by all that he hath done all his life-long.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, Let me add <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If our Duties be not done in Faith, truly, then inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the better for them, we ſhall certainly be the worſe for all the Duties that ever we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Now, what an uncomfortable thing is it for a man to labour and take pains, and all for loſs? You that trade in the World, that take a great deal of pains, are up early and down late; why, if ſo be that you go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in your eſtates, for all your pains-taking, and labour, and toyl: and travel, this will be very uncomfortable to you; to labour and toyl night and day, as it were, and all for loſs. Suppoſe now a great Merchant, he trades and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:151103:77"/> trafficks abroad at Sea, and trades at home by Land; and when he comes to caſt up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, he hath done all for loſs, he is not the richer, but a great deal the poorer, What an uncomfortable thing will this be to him, that he hath been labouring, and travelling, and toyling, and ſpending his ſtrength, and his time, and his pains, and all for loſs? He is the worſe, and not the better, as 'tis ſaid of the woman that had the bloody Iſſue, ſhe went to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and uſed the means, and ſtill ſhe was not the better, but the worſe. You would count this a very uncomfortable thing, if any of your Children or Relations ſhould be ſick, and you call for the help of the Phyſitian, and he applies means, and ſtill all the Phyſick that is taken tends to the hurt of the Party, he is never the better, but the worſe for all the means that is uſed, truly it would make your hearts ake: Truely thus it is when a man hath been taking pains all his life-long, exerciſing of himſelf in holy Duties and Ordinances, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and ſerving God, and endeavouring to pleaſe God, as he thinks; but now inſtead of pleaſing God by what he hath done, he hath rather diſpleaſed God. For certainly, we are either the better or the worſe for every Ordinance that we partake in; when we come to hear a Sermon, if we do not go away bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we go away worſe; for the Word will work one way or other: And ſo far Prayer, if we be not the better, we are the worſe; when our Duties and Services have not been
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151103:78"/> done in Faith, they have not been pleaſing to the Lord. And when a man comes to caſt up his accounts, he will find himſelf the worſe for all the Services that ever he performed; becauſe they have not been done in Faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And let me add one word more, If our Duties and Services be not done in Faith, then I pray what have we been doing of all this time, but cheating and deceiving our own Souls; going on and taking pains, and all to delude and deceive our own Souls? We have been ſteering a wrong couſe; inſtead of making Chriſt our Righteouſneſs, we have been making a Chriſt of our Duties and Services, and ſo deceive our own Souls; if we do not act Faith in the performance of Duties, then we make a Chriſt of them, and ſo deceive our own Souls: for if we do not lean upon Chriſt, we lean upon them. A man or woman that doth not act Faith in their Duties and Services, they do but ſteer a wrong Courſe all their life-long. Suppoſe now a man ſhould ſteer his courſe at Sea by a Compaſs that is falſe, he may go on and ſail amain Night and Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind, he may go on in his Courſe; but all the way that he makes he doth but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf, he will never come to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he aims at, and deſires to come to: He doth but deceive and delude himſelf. Why? Becauſe he ſails by a falſe Compaſs, and ſo ſteers his Courſe wrong. Truly thus it is with many Profeſſors, they perform Duties, they go on with full ſail in Duties, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151103:78"/> Duties every day, and they attend upon the Lord, as they have opportunity, to hear the Word, and read the Word daily, they go on amain. Ay, but ſtill they ſteer a wrong Courſe, they ſail by a falſe Compaſs, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will never come to the Haven of Reſt, but will run upon their own ruine at laſt. Therefore obſerve it, the Devil will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Profeſſor to go on in a courſe of Duties, to pray every day in his Family and Cloſet; he will allow him to go on in a courſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, attending upon God daily, ſo long as his Duties and Services are not touched with the Loadſtone, if they be not done in Faith, he knows what will be the Iſſue of them; he lets him alone, becauſe he knows he doth but deceive himſelf and delude his own Soul: he looks to come to ſuch a Haven, but he will periſh and miſcarry for ever. Therefore, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I pray conſider, whether it be not a matter of very great concernment for every one of us to look to it, and be careful that all our Duties and Services be done in Faith, or elſe we can never pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well,</hi> This is the Queſtion, <hi>How ſhall we ſo perform our Duties and Services in Faith, as they may be pleaſing unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to it, there are ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that I ſhall lay down, that may be of general Concernment, and reach all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we are to perform, and ſhew you how we ſhall perform them in Faith, that they may be pleaſing unto God. And then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151103:79"/> we ſhall come to lay down more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Directions, how we may perform every Duty; as Prayer in Faith, and hearing the Word in Faith, and partaking of the Lords-Supper in Faith; how we may perform every Duty in Faith, that ſo we may pleaſe God in what we do.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then for the General Rules that we may make uſe of in all Duties, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of them in Faith, that ſo they may be pleaſing unto God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, take this for a general Rule that may be of concernment for every Duty, Let us look eſpecially that we be Believers, that we have a Faith in Chriſt; for if we be not Believers, we can never perform any Duty in Faith; we muſt firſt believe in Chriſt, before we can perform any duty in Faith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, Let us be ſure of that, that the work of Faith be wrought effectually in our hearts, that we do really and truely believe on Chriſt; be ſure of that, lay that for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and the more clear that is, the more ſure we are of that, that there is a real work of Faith wrought in our hearts, we may be the more eaſily perſwaded that what we do, we do in Faith; though that alone is not enough nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But without that, it is impoſſible for us to do any thing in Faith, ſo as to pleaſe God; it is by Faith that our perſons come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, without Faith our perſons are not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God: No; <hi>It is through the beloved, that we muſt be accepted in our perſons,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151103:79"/> And if our perſons be not accepted, nothing that we do can be accepted; No, we may pray day by day, and cry aloud, and we may perform extraordinary Duties too, and none of theſe accepted, if our perſons be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted through Faith in Chriſt; there muſt be the foundation of all: For, Brethren, it is by Faith that our hearts are purified and made holy; now if ſo be that we be not holy, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God by any thing that we can do; for he is a holy God, and whatſoever is pleaſing to God, muſt be holy. Now it <hi>is by Faith that our hearts come to be purified,</hi> Act. 15.9. By Faith we come to have an habitual Holineſs wrought in us, though there may be, and there is ſtill a body of ſin; but ſtill there is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Holineſs, by Faith, wrought in the heart, whereby we come to be made holy in Gods account. For if ſo be that we be not made holy through Faith, then all that ever we do is unclean, all that comes from us is unclean; look as the Fountain or Spring is, ſo is all that iſſues from it; every drop of water that comes from it, is accordingly. Can you bring forth a clean thing out of an unclean? None can do it. Does a bitter fountain ſend forth ſweet water? No it cannot be: The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt firſt be made clean and ſweet, or elſe all the ſtreams will be according as the fountain is. A corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good fruit; make the Tree good, or the fruit cannot be good. All that comes from a man or woman that is in a ſtate of unbelief, is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:151103:80"/> unclean; and whatever Duties or Ordinances he touches, is unclean and polluted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot pleaſe God. Look, as it was under the Law, if one that was Legally or Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unclean, touched any thing, it was unclean, Hag. 2.12, 13. <hi>If one bear holy fleſh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oyl, or any meat, ſhall it be holy? And the Prieſts anſwered and ſaid, no, it ſhall be unclean.</hi> So now, whatever Duties be performed under the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> if we be not Believers, if our hearts be not purified by Faith, truly then all that we touch is impure and unclean to us, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled</hi> (Who are thoſe? he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it in the very next words) <hi>and unbelieving, is nothing pure:</hi> They can do nothing that the Infinite, Holy and Pure God can be pleaſed with. Now there is no way for a Soul to be made clean, to lave an habitual Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but through Faith wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, and the application and ſprinkling of the Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt upon the Conſcience; So a man or woman comes to be made clean: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>For if the blood of bulls, and goats, and the Aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> that is, The Holy Water under the Law, that being ſprinkled upon the unclean did purifie him, and make him clean: and if the ſprinkling of that water did purifie from Ceremonial Uncleanneſs, <hi>How
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151103:80"/> much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt,</hi> verſe. 14. <hi>Who through the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf to God, purge your Conſeiences from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi> Two things the Apoſtle doth plainly hint to us in this Scripture;</p>
            <p>Namely, (1.) That all our Works that we perform before we be cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt, they are all but dead works, unholy and unclean. And then (2.) it implies thus much, That we come to be cleanſed from our dead works, by the ſprinkling of the Blood of Chriſt upon us, and that by the Eternal Spirit, the Spirit of God. This is the way, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way whereby a man or woman comes to be habitually clean and holy, by Faith in Chriſt, whereby the Soul is not only juſtified from the Guilt of ſin; but there is the Spirit of Chriſt conveyed and communicated to the ſoul, whereby there is a principle of Holineſs, of Habitual Holineſs put upon the Soul. Well, this is now the firſt general Rule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, Brethren and Friends, it is of great concernment to us to look to that; if we would act Faith in our Duties, ſo as to pleaſe God, we muſt firſt of all look that there be a work of Faith wrought in our hearts, that we do truly believe on Chriſt; and to that end we ſhould be venturing to lean the weight of our Souls upon Chriſt, and upon his Blood and Righteouſneſs, as it is tendred and held forth to us in the Goſpel: and to this end alſo, let us wraſtle with the Lord, and beg for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith to be given out to us. Chriſt hath
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151103:81"/> promiſed that our Heavenly Father will give the Holy Ghoſt to them that ask him: This is the firſt Rule, to look that we be true Believers.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Secondly, As Faith does poſſeſs the Soul with Habitual Holineſs; ſo it is by Faith alſo that a Soul comes to be cleanſed from actual Guilt; Therefore the Second Rule, to act in Faith, in our Duties and Performances, is to put away all Guilt, all ſinful Uncleanneſs from us, when we come to perform any Service, or offer up any Sacrifice to the Lord; If a Man or Woman come before the Lord in the guilt of any known ſin that he lives in, if he do not put that away, it makes all his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unclean, and not pleaſing to God. A man cannot act in Faith, ſo long as he comes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with any guilt upon his Conſcience, living in the neglect of any known Duty, or living in the commiſſion of any known ſin; if he live in it, he cannot act in Faith: Faith will purge and cleanſe the Soul from ſin, that he will put away all guilt when he comes to draw near to God. See what is ſaid in <hi>Job</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hands towards him: If Iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy tabernacle, for then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot,</hi> &amp;c. When you come to ſtretch out your hands towards God in Prayer, or when you come to draw near to him in any Duty, Then, ſaies he, <hi>if there be Iniquity in your hand, put it far away;</hi> Do not come to God in Prayer, or in any Ordinance, in any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:151103:81"/> known Sin that you do allow your ſelves in; for if you do, you cannot perform thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Faith, and ſo they cannot be pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: Therefore be ſure that you put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all evil from you. As now for Example, (to ſhew you the Application of this Rule, that you may know how to make uſe of it for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty) ſuppoſe now you go to prayer, if you would pray in Faith, ſo as to pleaſe God, you muſt not allow your ſelves in any known ſin; <hi>No,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 66.18. <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</hi> I cannot make a Prayer in Faith; If you have made a thouſand Prayers, though you be a Believer in the main, yet all thoſe Prayers that you have put up in ſuch a way, with the guilt of any known ſin upon you, that you allow your ſelf in, and go on in, your Prayers have not been put up in Faith, and ſo God will not regard them: Therefore be ſure of that, when you come to pray, ſee that you do not allow your ſelf in any known ſin. So if you come to hear the Word, if you would hear in Faith, ſo as to pleaſe God in it, you muſt put away all evil out of your hands; In <hi>Jam</hi> 1.21. ſays the Apoſtle there, <hi>Lay aſide all filthineſs, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> Do you deſire to hear the Word in Faith, ſo as it may be a ſaving Word to your Souls? Then <hi>Lay aſide all Filthineſs and Superfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> Allow your ſelf in no known ſin, when you come to draw near to God in any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151103:82"/> Ordinance. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 1, 2. ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>Laying aſide all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and guile, and hypocriſie, and envy, and evil-ſpeaking, as new-born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Do you deſire to hear the Word, ſo as you may pleaſe God in your hearing? Then let there be no Envy, nor Malice, nor Hypocriſie allowed in your hearts; for elſe you cannot receive the Word, ſo as to be milk to your Souls, ſo as to grow and profit by it. And ſo alſo, if you come to any other Ordinance, as to the Lords-Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, you muſt come in Faith to it, and partake in Faith, or elſe we cannot pleaſe God by it. Now this is one way whereby we come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in Faith, namely, by cleanſing our ſelves: Saies the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. ſpeaking by way of Alluſion to the Paſſover, <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed for us, let us therefore keep the Feaſt, not with the old leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth.</hi> If we draw near to God in this Ordinance, we muſt cleanſe our ſelves, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Draw near to God, and God will draw near to you.</hi> And how ſhall we draw near to God, ſo as God may draw near to us? Mark what follows, <hi>Cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners; and purifie your hearts, ye double-minded.</hi> Here is the way for us to draw near to God in a way of Faith; for it is properly the work of Faith to purge the Heart, and to purge the Hands: That is the ſecond Direction, that may ſerve as a General Direction, to help us to draw near
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:151103:82"/> to God, in any Duty or Ordinance, ſo as to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third</hi> way to perform Duties, ſo as to pleaſe God, is this; It is the proper work of Faith to empty the Soul of it ſelf. Now if you will draw near to God in any Duty or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo as to pleaſe God, then come with Self-emptyings; for Faith is a ſelf-emptying Grace; that is the proper work of Faith, to empty the Soul of it ſelf. Now there are two things that Faith does empty the Soul of in the performance of holy Duties; The one is, It empties the Soul of the ſenſe of its own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and Ability to perform holy Duties; and alſo it empties the Soul of the ſenſe of its own worthineſs, to receive any Mercy from the Lord, in any Duty or Ordinance: Theſe two things Faith doth empty the Soul of, and ſo you ſhall find it, that where Faith hath been acted and exerciſed, there hath been Self-emptyings. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that did live much in the excerciſe of Faith, and he profeſſes it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. That he <hi>Lived by the Faith of the Son of God;</hi> and you may obſerve how the Apoſtle emptied himſelf of Self-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and Self-worthineſs; for Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, ſays he, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>We know not how to pray, nor what to pray for as we ought.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that was ſuch a great proficient in the School of Chriſt, ſuch an eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet ſaies he, <hi>We know not how to pray,</hi> he was empty of Self-ſufficiency, and, ſaies he, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151103:83"/> to think any thing as of our ſelves; but our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God.</hi> Saies he, <hi>I am ſo inſufficient that I cannot ſo much as think a good thought.</hi> What was he ſufficient for then? <hi>And,</hi> ſaies he in another place, <hi>I cannot ſo much as will or deſire any thing that is good. It is God,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that worketh in us both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure. And,</hi> ſaies he in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>though I be nothing;</hi> What a word is this? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that was one of the eminenteſt Saints that lived upon the face of the earth in his days, yet ſays he, <hi>I am nothing! Paul</hi> living by Faith, was emptied of the ſenſe of his own ſufficiency; and truly ſo alſo he was emptied of Self-worthineſs of receiving any Mercy from God: For all his Duties and Services, ſaies he, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints;</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>To me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this Grace given,</hi> &amp;c. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. ſaies he, <hi>I am the leaſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> So, if you obſerve it, you may find it in all thoſe that lived in the exerciſe of Faith, how they have been emptied of the ſenſe of their own worthineſs; <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, ſee how he lay low, and even crept in the duſt before the Lord, and acknowledged himſelf not worthy to ſpeak to the Lord in Prayer for <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he was fain to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for himſelf at every turn, <hi>Let not the Lord be angry, that I who am but duſt and aſhes have undertaken to ſpeak unto the Lord, Gen.</hi> 18.27, 30, 32. I am unworthy, ſaies he, to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151103:83"/> the Lord for any Mercy either for my ſelf or <hi>Sodom.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jacob, Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy Mercies, Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt Mercy from thee.</hi> Thus Faith does empty the Soul, both of ſelf-ſufficiency, and alſo of ſelf-worthineſs. Now then, to ſhew you how you ſhould make uſe of this Rule, It will ſerve for every Duty that we perform; when we come to pray, we ſhould draw near to God with this ſenſe of our inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, to lift up a Prayer unto God; we ſhould come to God with a ſenſe upon our hearts of our inability to perform the work; and alſo with a ſence of our own unworthineſs, that God ſhould hear our Prayers; when we have prayed never ſo well, as others may judge, yet we muſt come with ſelf-abaſing, and ſelf-emptying: So if we go to hear the Word, if we would hear in Faith, we ſhould make uſe of this Rule, Lord I am unworthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to hear thy Word; I am unworthy that thou ſhouldſt ſpeak to me; and I am inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to hear thy Word as I ought to hear it: Thus come with ſelf-emptying, and ſelf-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So when we come to the Lords-Supper, Lord, I have no ſtrength now to partake of this Ordinance, as I ought to do; I cannot prepare my ſelf for it; I have no ſtrength to partake of it; I have no ſufficiency at all to partake of this or any other Ordinance, as I ought to do; and I am unworthy that the Lord ſhould draw near to me, to let me have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:151103:84"/> any Fellowſhip or Communion with himſelf: This is the Third general Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we would perform all Duties, and partake in all Ordinances in Faith, ſo as we may pleaſe God in what we do, Then let us do all that we do in the Name of Chriſt; for there is all our worthineſs and all our accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. You know the Apoſtle gives us this Rule, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt is our great High-Prieſt, and Jeſus Chriſt is our Altar too, by whom, and upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>, do all in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt; or elſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151103:84"/> you do not do it in Faith, and it will not be pleaſing unto God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, What is it to perform a Duty in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as it may be acceptable and pleaſing to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer; Brethren, It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to make mention of the Name of Chriſt in our Prayers, and to ſay, Through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, as you commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your Prayers (I do not blame you for this;) But it is not the naming of the Name of Chriſt, that is this doing of it in the Name of Chriſt. What is it then, you will ſay, for me to pray, or hear the Word, or partake of any Ordinance in the Name of Chriſt? Briefly, (for I would not inlarge) there are theſe Three things implied in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we do look for our acceſs into the preſence of God through Chriſt, and for his ſake; ſays the Apoſtle, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>For through him we both have an acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> Through him we both, that is, both Jews and Gentiles, have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father; we have acceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of the Father through Chriſt. You know, Brethren, after <hi>Adam</hi> fell and tranſgreſſed, he was driven out from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Before, indeed, he had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and acceſs into the preſence of God: but after he had broken the Covenant that God had made with him, he was driven out from the preſence of God; and there was a Flaming Sword that ſtood to keep him from

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:151103:86"/> coming near to God. And ſo all his poſterity are now driven from the preſence of God, and cannot have acceſs into the preſence of God, but through Chriſt; and through him we may have acceſs with boldneſs, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come therefore boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.</hi> Through him we may come and have acceſs into the preſence of God, with boldneſs and confidence; that is one thing that is implyed by performing any Duty in the Name of Chriſt, to look for our acceſs into the preſence of God through him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To do it in the Name of Chriſt, is to look for ſtrength and aſſiſtance to perform our Duties from Chriſt: for as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are altogether inſufficient of our ſelves to do any thing, or think any thing that is good; not only as we are in a ſtate of nature before Converſion, or before we be brought to believe in Chriſt; for that is a ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Apoſtle deſcribes to be without ſtrength, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. But this is not only the condition of Unbelievers, but even Believers themſelves are inſufficient of themſelves to do any thing that is pleaſing to God; as you may ſee in thoſe Scriptures that I mentioned to you even now. You cannot pray, no nor think a good thought; you cannot will, nor deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing; ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>I am nothing, and I can do nothing;</hi> and yet ſaies the Apoſtle in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Through the help and ſtrength
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151103:86"/> of Chriſt I can pray, and I can hear the Word, and I can partake of the Lords-Supper in a way of Faith through Chriſt, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muninion with Chriſt in it, when there is Grace and ſtrength communicated from Chriſt. This is the Second thing implied, To do every thing in the Name of Chriſt, is to be looking for all our help from Chriſt and him alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is this further implied in it, when we perform any Duty in the Name of Chriſt, we look for all our acceptance of what we have done and performed only for Chriſt's ſake, and through Chriſt, that the Lord ſhould do this or that for us for Chriſt's ſake, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in, Pet. 2.5. <hi>Ye are,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>a holy Prieſthood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You come and offer up your Sacrifices, your Prayers to God, your Duties and Services; But how ſhall they be acceptable to God? How? only by Jeſus Chriſt; this is to perform a Duty in the Name of Chriſt; namely, when we look for acceſs into the preſence of God, to ſtand with a holy boldneſs in the preſence of God with our Services through his being pleaſing to the Father, and when we look for all our help and ſtrength to the performance of our Duties from Chriſt, and when we expect all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our Duties and Services through Chriſt. Now that you may ſee how to apply this Rule, and make uſe of it; ſuppoſe now you are to pray, you would pray in Faith, ſo as to pleaſe God, come then in the Name of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151103:87"/> Jeſus Chriſt. How? When I pray, I am to look to have acceſs into the preſence of God with my Prayers through him, and I am to expect aſſiſtance and ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt to enable me to do it: And I am to look for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance and acceptance of my Prayers that I have performed, only through Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo I might ſhew you for hearing the Word: 'Tis a general Rule, we are to hear in Faith. How? Namely, to hear the Word in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt: How is that? Thus to come and preſent our ſelves in preſence of God through Chriſt, in Obedience to his Will, that we may have acceſs and ſtand in his preſence in that Duty and Service through Jeſus Chriſt; and to expect Grace and Strength from Chriſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to attend unto the Word as I ought to do; without him I cannot hear as I ſhould: but in hearing I ſhall not hear, if I have not ſtrength from Chriſt to enable me; and when we have done, to look for acceptance through Chriſt, of the ſervice that I have done. And ſo for partaking of the Lords-Supper, we ſhould do all in the Name of Chriſt; look for acceſs into the preſence of God in that Ordinance through Chriſt; look to have aſſiſtance to be carried on in the participation of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by ſtrength from Chriſt; and ſo look for acceptance of our participation of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance through Jeſus Chriſt. That is the Forth General Rule.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take one more; Would we ſo act Faith in our duties and Services, that they may be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151103:87"/> pleaſing unto God, the Rule is this; namely, to come with a reſting and relying upon Chriſt, with expectation to have that given out unto us by the Ordinance, for which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was inſtituted and appointed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Reſting upon God,</hi> and <hi>Waiting upon God,</hi> are frequently called <hi>Faith</hi> in Scripture: ſaies <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. All my expectation is from God; <hi>My Soul, wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from Him.</hi> Therefore will I reſt upon him for the giving out of what I do expect from him. And ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is everlaſting ſtrength:</hi> Truſt in him for ever. Whenever you come to any Duty or Ordinance, ſtill act in Faith, reſting upon God with an expectation to receive that from God, that he hath appointed the Ordinance for: As now, Suppoſe for Prayer; When we come to wait upon God in Prayer, we ſhould come reſting upon God, with an expection to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that from God which the Duty is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for. To pray in Faith, is not for a Man or Woman to believe, and be perſwaded that he ſhall receive the particular thing that he prays for; No, we do but deceive our ſelves, if we think this be to pray in Faith. For we may pray in Faith, and yet not have the particular thing given that we pray for, as I could inſtance in ſeveral examples: But that ſhall not be my buſineſs now. But to pray in Faith, is only this, namely, to rely upon God, he being a God hearing prayer, that he would hear my

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:151103:89"/> Prayer, and grant my Petitions ſo far as they are according to his Will, at his own time and leaſure; <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 65.2. <hi>to thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> His Faith was built upon that, that God was a God hearing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and he relied upon God, and expected that God would anſwer his Prayer in his own time. And remember this, for it is a daily Duty that we are to perfom; Though we may be Believers, and have an Habit of Holineſs in us, yet if we do not act Faith in Prayer, our Prayer is not acceptable and pleaſing unto God becauſe it is not done in Faith; it muſt be a Prayer of Faith, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls it, ſo to pray as to be perſwaded to believe and reſt upon God, that ſo far as my Prayer is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will, he will hear and anſwer in his own time, and in his own way. And ſo for hearing of the Word, you may make uſe of this Rule, namely, to reſt and wait upon the Lord, and expect ſomething to be given out from the Lord in that very Ordinance, for which the Ordinance was appointed, namely, to hear ſomething ſpoken from God to me, that I may be further acquainted withal: In <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.33. ſee what <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Peter: Peter</hi> was ſent from God to ſpeak to him; ſaies he, <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear what God ſhall ſpeak:</hi> We are all here preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, expecting to have ſomething ſpoken from the Lord. It is the Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and we are to wait upon God in it, with an expectation to have ſomething from
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151103:89"/> God. Alas! we come to hear the Word, and we may go away as we come, if we do not hear in Faith; we ſhould come with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to hear ſomething from God. I will hearken to hear what God the Lord will ſpeak to me; it is his Ordinance, and the way and means which God hath appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of himſelf to us: and ſo we muſt reſt and rely upon the Lord by Faith for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſpoken, that may be of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us. And ſo for receiving the Lords-Supper, this general Rule will help you in that; Come to that Ordinance, reſting upon God in a way of Faith, expecting ſomething from the Lord to be given out in that Ordinance, for which the Ordinance eſpecially was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And what is that? To have communion with Chriſt, and a communication and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Bleſſings of Chriſt, of the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> It was procured and purchaſed by Chriſt's Death and Bloodſhed. Now then, I ſay, here is the Rule, When we come to a Duty and Ordinance, come in a way of reſting and expectation to have ſomething communicated to us from the Lord of the Ordinance, ſomething of that which God hath appointed the Ordinance and Duty for. So now, you ſee here are five General Rules that may help us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Spiritual Duties, in a way of Faith, ſo as we may pleaſe God in them.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151103:90"/> And, O Brethren and Friends! ſhould any of us be willing to perform Duties and enjoy Ordinances in vain from day to day Why, as you have heard, if we go on not to act Faith in what we do, all will be in vain. And are you willing to be the worſe for the Duties that you perform, and the Ordinances that you enjoy? Truly, if we do not act Faith in them, we ſhall inſtead of being the better be the worſe for them; we cannot pleaſe God, but ſhall diſpleaſe him more and more. And ſo, are we willing to meet with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments at laſt? when we come to lie down upon our Sick-bed and Death-bed, and expect that we have been pleaſing God by what we have done; and we ſhall meet with a Diſappointment, becauſe we have done nothing in Faith, and ſo have not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, but diſpleaſed him? And are you willing to deceive your own Souls, as you have heard? We may go on in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Duties and Services, and ſteer a wrong Courſe, miſſing of Chriſt, if our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Services be not touched with the Loadſtone of Faith. Therefore, I ſay, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is of concernment to us to conſider theſe general Rules that have been given, to direct us how to perform Duties and enjoy Ordinances in a way of Faith, that ſo they may be pleaſing unto God. There are particular Rules that I ſhall deſire, if the Lord pleaſe, to lay down, How we may ſo pray in Faith that our Prayers
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151103:90"/> may be pleaſing unto God; and then ſhew you, how we may hear the Word in Faith, that thereby we may pleaſe God, and profit our own Souls: And ſo come afterward to ſome other things, as the Lord gives opportunity.</p>

            <p>The laſt time we came to enter upon ſome directions how we might ſo exerciſe Faith in the performance of Duties, and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Ordinances, that ſo what we do might pleaſe God; ſome general Directions were laid down that may ſerve for all Duties; I ſhall now go on through the Lords aſſiſtance, and give you ſome more particular directions, how we may perform particular duties in Faith, that ſo they may be pleaſing unto God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And in the firſt place, we ſhall begin with the duty of Prayer, and ſhew you how we may ſo pray in Faith, as we may pleaſe God, for that is the Prayer that God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:151103:91"/> That is, a prayer of Faith: Therefore it is ſaid; in <hi>James</hi> 5.15. That <hi>the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick;</hi> That is, there muſt be Faith exerciſed in our prayers, or elſe our prayers are not true prayers, ſuch as God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Suppoſe a man be a Believer, and have a habit of Faith, he prays, yet if he do not exerciſe Faith in his prayer, he prays not the prayer of Faith, and it will not avail. <hi>James</hi> 1.6, <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God.</hi> He muſt pray to God for it; but ſays he, <hi>Let him pray in faith, for elſe if he do not pray in faith, his prayer will not avail.</hi> And he ſpeaks to thoſe that are faithful, for he writes to the Twelve Tribes, amongſt whom were many faithful and believers; <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God; but let him ask it in faith, nothing wavering;</hi> for elſe his prayer is not pleaſing to God; as the Apoſtle ſays in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.19, <hi>I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> So I may ſay in this Caſe, a man had better put up five prayers in Faith, than Ten thouſand prayers without Faith; and though we ſpeak but a few Words in prayer, if it be mixed with Faith, it is more available than if we ſpeak never ſo many words never ſo largely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well, you will ſay, <hi>How ſhall we ſo act faith in prayer, that our prayers may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:151103:92"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer, Beſides what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed before, that the perſon muſt be a Believer, and alſo paſſing by thoſe general Rules of direction laid down before, I ſhall give you four or five particular directions, how we ſhould ſo pray in Faith, that our prayers may be pleaſing unto God. Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhould be ſure of this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we do pray for, be according to the Will of God, be ſure of that, be perſwaded of that; you muſt not doubt nor queſtion that, for if you do you cannot pray in Faith: And tho' the thing you pray for be according to the Will of God, yet if you do not know and be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it is according to the Will of God, you cannot pray in Faith; therefore we muſt be ſure of that, that the thing we pray for be according to the Will of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith concerning eating, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> laſt, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eateth;</hi> That is, he committeth a damnable ſin becauſe he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not; for whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin. So he that prays doubtingly, whether the thing he prays for be according to the Will of God or no, he ſins in prayer, whatever he pray for, if it be not in Faith, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that what he prays for is according to the Will of God, this man cannot pray in Faith. Suppoſe now a man or woman pray for this or that, that he cannot certainly conclude is according to the Will of God, as now for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuppoſe a man have an earneſt deſire to encreaſe his eſtate in the World, that he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151103:92"/> may live bravely at his eaſe and pleaſure, and to that end he deſires to be diligent in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and to that end alſo he begs of the Lord in prayer, that the Lord would bleſs his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and endeavours, that he might gain a great eſtate in the world, and do what he liſt, and live at his eaſe and pleaſure; now, this man cannot pray with a certain aſſurance and perſwaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that this thing is according to the Will of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Ye ask and have not,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>James, becauſe ye ask amiſs, to ſpend upon your luſts, James</hi> 4.3. It is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God, and therefore you cannot pray in Faith. Or ſuppoſe now that a man or woman intend to take a Journey upon pleaſure, to have a Ramble abroad, he would be glad to be preſerved, and poſſibly he prays that the Lord would keep him in his way; now if a perſon in this caſe do queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Journey be according to the Will of God, he cannot pray in Faith, and ſo his prayer is not pleaſing to the Lord: Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man be gaming for money, and he would be glad to win, poſſibly he prays that the Lord would bleſs him in his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that he might win, he cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded this is according to the Will of God, and if ſo, he cannot pray in Faith, and ſo his prayer is not pleaſing unto God: So that, I ſay, this is the particular direction in this caſe, That whatſoever we pray for, we muſt be ſure of that, that it is according to the Will of God; and this is a good help to pray in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151103:93"/> Faith; ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14, <hi>This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</hi> You muſt be ſure of that, that it is according to the Will of God, and then we may believe that he will hear us. Now, I pray conſider this, a thing may be agreeable to the revealed Will of God, and yet not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſecret Will and Purpoſe; and though the purpoſe of God be againſt what we pray for, yet if it be according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God, we may lawfully pray in Faith for it. As now, ſuppoſe a man or woman pray for the life of ſuch a Relation, a Husband, or a Wife, or a Child, or a Friend, he prays earneſtly for their life; well, God in his ſecret purpoſe hath determined other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the ſecret Will of God is contrary, yet this being lawful according to the revealed Will of God, to pray for the wellfare of the ſick, he may pray in Faith, though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſecret Purpoſe and Counſel of God. You know this was <hi>David</hi>'s caſe, he prayed earneſtly for his ſick Child, the Lord had a ſecret purpoſe that the Child ſhould dye, yet he prayed earneſtly for the life of the Child, and he did not ſin in praying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was according to the revealed Will of God; and though it was contrary to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will of God, yet notwithſtanding, he might pray in Faith for the life of the Child, though God had intended otherwiſe. You know it was the caſe of Chriſt himſelf, he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151103:93"/> prayed that the Cup might paſs from him; it was the determinate Purpoſe and Counſel of God that the Cup ſhould not paſs from him, but he ſhould drink it. Now, did Chriſt ſin in praying for that which was contrary to the ſecret Will and Purpoſe of God? No. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now this is certain, that it is a thing that is lawful, and according to the Will of God, for a Man or Woman to pray againſt that which is dangerous and hurtful to his nature; he may pray lawfully to be delivered from evil. Now Chriſt prayed to be delivered from evil, from drinking the Cup of Gods Wrath, though it was the ſecret Counſel of God he ſhould drink it, yet notwithſtanding he did not ſin, becauſe he prayed for that which he knew was according to the revealed Will of God. Well, this is the firſt Direction, and I pray mind it, That if you would pray in Faith for any mercy, let us be ſure of that, that what we pray for be according to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond Direction, To pray in Faith, ſo as that we may pleaſe God, is to pray in obedience to the Will of God; do it in obedience to the Will and Command of God as our Duty. Brethren, it is the Will and Command of God, and our Duty, that we ſhould pray always, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.4. <hi>Seek the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeek his face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> So, you know, in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a Parable to his Diſciples, to the end, that Men ſhould always pray and not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:151103:94"/> faint. It is the Will of God that we ſhould pray always; now to help us to pray in Faith, it is good to be Eying our Duty and the Lords Command; it is the Lords Command that we ſhould pray, notwithſtanding we may meet with diſcouragements, objections, and temptations from the Fleſh and from Satan, to take us off from the Duty; as now, the Fleſh and Satan will be ready to ſuggeſt and diſcourage, thus, why, What benefit have you by all the Prayers that ever you have made? What have you found in a way of anſwer to your Prayer? and again, do you not ſee that others that do not pray at all, fare even as well as you, for all your praying? and again, can we change the Mind and Will of God by all our Prayers? It is ſaid in <hi>Job,</hi> that God is of one mind, and who can turn him? Can all the prayers of all the Saints and Angels in Heaven and Earth change the Mind and Will of God? But now, Faith will help a Soul to go over all theſe Objections; it is my Duty, and I will do it in Obedience to the Will of God, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, or that, or the other Temptation, God hath commanded me to pray evermore, and Pray without ceaſing; and that I ſhould pray and not faint; poſſibly Satan will come with his Temptations and Objections, Do you not ſee that God ſeems to be angry, and offended with your Prayers? God ſeems to anſwer you contrary to your Prayers? then to what end is it for you to pray? Yet Faith will help a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:151103:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> Soul to anſwer all, with this, It is my Duty, it is Gods command, and therefore I will do it. For Faith does carry a Soul beyond Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Objections; As you ſee it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Faith carried him beyond all his carnal reaſonings and objections: As when God called him to go out of his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into a place that he knew not, and it may be ſcarce ever heard of in all his Life, Fleſh and Blood now, and the Devil, would be ready to make Objections, What! ſhall a Man venture to go he knows not whither? But now Faith help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to go on, therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.8. <hi>By Faith, Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> He went, becauſe of the Command of God, in obedience to the call of God. So when <hi>Abraham</hi> was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a hard piece of Service, to offer up <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> here might have been a Temptation, What, ſhall I go and cut the Throat of him in whom all the promiſes are to be performed? From <hi>Iſaac</hi> Chriſt was to come; and God had told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in him all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed; yet go, ſaies God, and ſacrifice your Son. Here was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Abraham</hi> goes, notwithſtanding all the Cavils and objections of carnal reaſon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> goes about it in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. Brethren, take this as another direction to help us to pray in Faith, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the objections and Temptations
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151103:95"/> that may take us off; it is our duty, here is the Command of God for it, and out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Command I will do it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever come of it. You read in the 5th of <hi>Luke,</hi> the beginning, that <hi>Peter</hi> had been Fiſhing all Night, and had Caught nothing; in the Morning Chriſt ſtood upon the ſhore and called to him; ſaies he, <hi>Caſt your Net on the Right ſide of the Ship:</hi> Sir, ſaies he, we have been labouring and toyling all Night, and have caught nothing, it is but a vain thing: But yet he did recollect himſelf, nevertheleſs at thy Command we will do it; and thereupon caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Net upon Chriſt's command, they had a very great Draught, in ſo much that they were Amazed. Well, this is the ſecond direction to help us to pray in Faith, to pray in Obedience to the Lords Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third Direction is this; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be eying of the Lords Promiſe, and to pray by vertue of ſome promiſe or other, and this will mightily ſtrengthen and help Faith in Prayer: If a Soul have but a promiſe to encourage him in Prayer, by this means the Soul will come to ſee, as through a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Willingneſs of God to hear him, and anſwer him.</p>
            <p>The Soul may, poſſibly, ſcruple and Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, But if I pray, will the Lord hear me? But if the Soul comes in the vertue of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he comes with a great encouragement and perſwaſion that God will hear him. Now, Brethren, for your help in this thing, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:151103:95"/> by vertue of ſome promiſe, underſtand and know, that there are two ſorts of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there are ſome more general promiſes concerning Gods hearing Prayer, and then there are ſome more particular promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome particular Mercy or Bleſſing that we pray for. Now, as for the general promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Scripture is full of them, that God is a God hearing prayer, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.2. <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayer, unto thee ſhall all Fleſh come.</hi> God is a God hearing Prayer, for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of all Fleſh to come unto him. So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 86.4, 5. <hi>Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my Soul, for thou, Lord, art good, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive, and Plenteous in Mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</hi> Here is a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; ſo in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102.17. <hi>He will regard the Prayer of the Deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.8. <hi>The Lord is nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that call upon him, that call upon him in Truth; He is nigh them to hear their Prayer.</hi> So in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you; for every one that asketh receiveth, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo you have ſuch expreſſions frequently up and down in the Scripture, that are general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to encourage the Soul in Prayer; as the Apoſtle ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>The ſame Lord over all, is Rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> Such general promiſes you have frequently in the Scripture; and then there are ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſes about Gods hearing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151103:96"/> as now, for ſome particular Mercy or Bleſſing that a Man or Woman may ſtand in need of, there are ſome particular promiſes that ſuits them more particularly. As you know, <hi>Jacob</hi> he makes uſe of that, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid that thou would'ſt do me good.</hi> When he was in danger by his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10, 11. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid that thou would'ſt do me good.</hi> God had promiſed to bleſs him, and he makes uſe of that promiſe, and ſtrengthens his Faith in his Prayer by that Argument. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. there you may read how the Lord made a gracious promiſe to <hi>David</hi> and his Houſe, to eſtabliſh the Throne to him and his poſterity, that his Poſterity ſhould ſucceed him in his Throne; <hi>David</hi> would have built God a Houſe, <hi>Well,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>wilt thou build me a Houſe; I will build thy Houſe for thee.</hi> There was a Gracious promiſe; well, <hi>David</hi> makes uſe of this promiſe in the latter end of the Chapter, verſe, 27 <hi>For thou, Oh Lord of Hoſts, God of Iſrael, haſt revealed unto thy Servant, ſaying, I will build thee an Houſe, therefore hath thy Servant found in his Heart to pray this Prayer unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. having his Land invaded by a Foreign Enemy, he goes to God in Prayer; but mark how he eyes a promiſe in his Prayer, verſ. 8, 9. <hi>And have built thee a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therein for thy name, ſaying, If when evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us, as the Sword, Judgement, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or Famine, we ſtand before this Houſe, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151103:96"/> in thy preſence (for thy Name is in this Houſe) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help, &amp;c.</hi> He takes hold of the promiſe of God, and pleads that in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo prevails. So I might inſtance in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſometimes God caſts in a promiſe, gives ſome ſecret hint of a promiſe in Prayer: As <hi>Paul,</hi> he had that promiſe, when he was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Thorn in the Fleſh, and a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, God told him, that <hi>his Grace ſhould be ſufficient for him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. And he makes uſe of that, and gathers ſtrength from it. But Suppoſe, now, a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have no particular promiſe to ſtrengthen his Faith in Prayer, then let him eye ſome general promiſe or other, and this will be a mighty encouragement and ſtrengthning, and help to Faith in prayer, to encline the Heart to be perſwaded that God is willing, becauſe of ſuch general promiſes: Or ſuppoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man or Woman have no promiſe to lay hold upon, or to act Faith in Prayer upon, then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the Fourth place, take a fourth direction, and that is, to eye the Name of God; the Attributes of God they are called the Name of God, thereby God doth diſcover himſelf and his nature to us, and plead by vertue of ſome attribute of God, the Name of God; for ſometimes a Believer may be in the dark, and may not have the light of ſo much as any one promiſe to make uſe of. Now, you know what the Holy-Ghoſt ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.10.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151103:97"/> Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in Darkneſs, and ſees no light, not the light of any Promiſe, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s God; let him make uſe of the Name of God to ſtrengthen his Faith. The Saints and People of God have been wont to plead for the Name of God, and the Glory of Gods Name; that you find frequently in the Scripture, in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> 14.7. <hi>O Lord, though our iniquities teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy againſt us, do thou it for thy Names-ſake.</hi> So in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> frequently, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.11. <hi>For thy Name-ſake, Oh Lord, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</hi> But more particularly, eye ſome Attribute of God, ſome particular Name of God, as I may ſo call it, for God is made known and diſcovered to us by his attributes, and the properties of his Name; now let us eye ſome Attribute of God that may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us in Prayer, as now the Power of God, it is very uſeful to eye the Power of God in Prayer; and ſo you will find the Saints have made uſe of the power of God, that was put forth in the Creation of the World; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Chapter 32. when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go into Captivity for ſeventy years, the Lord bad <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to buy the Field of his Uncle, for an evidence that God would bring his people back again. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> when he had done, he would fall to Prayer, and he makes uſe of the power of God at the 17th verſe, <hi>Ah Lord God, behold, thou haſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151103:97"/> made the Heavens and Earth by thy great Power, and ſtretched out Arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.</hi> It is a hard thing for Fleſh and Blood to believe that I and my poſterity ſhall have this Land again; but there is nothing too hard for thee, God can eaſily bring them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from their long Captivity: ſo you may ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> did eye the Power of God, in <hi>Numbers</hi> 14.17, 18. <hi>And now, I beſeech thee, let the Power of my Lord be great according as thou haſt ſpoken, &amp;c.</hi> He urges the greatneſs of Gods Power; and ſo <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> in that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Oh Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>art not thou God in Heaven, and ruleſt not thou over all the Kingdoms of the Heathen, and in thine Hand is there not power and might, ſo that none is able to withſtand thee?</hi> And ſo <hi>Aſa,</hi> when he alſo was in the like diſtreſs, when his Land was invaded, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. he cried to the Lord, and mark how he eyed the Power of God; And he ſaid, <hi>Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with a many, or with them that have no power; help us, O Lord, our God, for we reſt on thee, and in thy Name we go againſt this Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> And ſo, if you obſerve, when Chriſt gives us directions to pray, in that which is called the Lords Prayer, ſtill in our prayer we are to eye the Power of God, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory.</hi> Still eye the Glory of Gods Power, and this is more helpful to Faith than we are aware of; you know, when many came to Chriſt in their diſtreſſes, when he was here upon Earth, for help, the poor Leper,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151103:98"/> when he came to Chriſt, he came with this, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean, Mat.</hi> 8.2. And ſaies Chriſt to the Father of the Child that was poſſeſt, when he came to him to caſt out the Devil, <hi>Canſt thou believe,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>that I am able to do this?</hi> becauſe he queſtioned the Power of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22. <hi>Lord if thou canſt do any thing, have compaſſion on us and help us,</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>if thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth, Verſe</hi> 23. He would have him to eye his Power, and the eying of the Power of God doth wonderfully ſtrengthen Faith, and enable us to pray in Faith. And ſo again, eye the mercy, and goodneſs, and kindneſs, and grace, and compaſſion of God in Prayer, and that will help us in our prayers, ſtrengthen Faith in the Mercy of God. You read of it frequently in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made uſe of that in his Prayer, <hi>For thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſake deliver me, and have mercy upon me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, Pſal.</hi> 51.1. So <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17, 18. He argues the Cauſe with God in his Prayer, upon the account of his Mercy, <hi>Let the Power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lord is long ſuffering, and of great Mercy, forgiving iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>Pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this People, according to the greatneſs of thy Mercy.</hi> This is now the fourth direction to help us to pray in Faith, namely, to eye the Name of God, the Glory of his Name, ſome of his Glorious Attributes, and plead the vertue of them. To name but one more:</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:151103:98"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To pray in Faith, is to pray with a hope and expectation of an audience of our prayers; there is much lies in this, many pray, and pray, and never look after their Prayers; they pray without any hope or expectation of Gods hearing and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Prayers. Now, I ſay, we ſhould pray with hope and expectation, waiting for an anſwer of our Prayers from the Lord one way or other, in the Lords own way; for ſometimes the Lord may anſwer us in a way that we could not expect, not in that particular thing that we pray for: As <hi>David</hi> ſaies, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13. <hi>But as for me, when they were ſick, my cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was Sackcloth, I humbled my Soul with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my Prayer returned into mine own Boſom.</hi> There was an anſwer, but not a particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what he Prayed for; yet he had an anſwer: ſo God may anſwer our Prayer, and we ſhould pray, hoping and waiting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an anſwer; for Faith doth help us ſo to act, to look up and wait. In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 5.3. ſaies <hi>David, My voice ſhalt thou hear, in the morning, Oh Lord, in the Morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> I will look after it, ſays he, and wait for ſome anſwer or other; There are many that commonly put up their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Morning and Evening, and turn their Backs, and never mind what anſwer God will give them; this is not to pray in Faith; Faith doth help a Soul to look up, and wait for an anſwer one way or other, at one time or another. In <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 2.1. He had been making his Prayer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151103:99"/> unto God in the former Chapter, and now ſaies he, <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the Tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; and then</hi> verſe 3 <hi>For the viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lye, though it tarry: wait for it.</hi> Ah! Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there is more in this than we are aware of, namely, to wait in hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an anſwer of our Prayers one way or other in the Lords time, this we may expect. God having revealed and made known himſelf to be a God hearing Prayer, and he hath not ſaid to the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye me in vain. Now, the Soul may draw near to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with hopes and expectations that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God hearing prayer, will one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear and anſwer my Prayers; look for it and expect it.</p>
            <p>And, Brethren, this waiting and expecting an Audience and anſwer of our Prayers from God, doth, as it were, lay an ingagement upon God to anſwer our Prayers. As now, if a man knows that another truſts in him for a thing, it does lay an ingagement upon him to be the more careful to do it; So now, when a Soul doth truſt in the Lord, and rely upon him, expecting Audience, becauſe he hath declared himſelf to be a God hearing Prayer, now God is ingaged as it were to anſwer thee; ſaies <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Thou Lord, haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi> The Lord will not forſake them that ſeek; we may forſake our Prayers
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151103:99"/> when we have made them, but the Lord will not forſake them that ſeek him; as he ſaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34. the laſt Verſe, <hi>None of them that truſt in him ſhall be deſolate.</hi> God is a God hearing Prayer, therefore none that truſt in him ſhall be deſolate; thus we are to wait for, and expect an anſwer of our Prayers, and God will hear us. And thus now you have had ſome few Directions given and laid down to help us to pray in Faith; and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by thus Praying in Faith we ſhall avail much, this is the prevailing Prayer, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith we cannot expect to prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay to me, The Truth is, I hope I have Prayed in Faith, I have been perſwaded that what I have Prayed for hath been according to the Will of God, and I have Prayed out of Obedience to the Command of God, and I have had an eye to the promiſe, &amp;c. And yet I do not find any anſwer of my Prayer, and therefore I have cauſe to queſtion whether ever I have Prayed in Faith or no: <hi>How ſhall I know whether my Prayer have been a Prayer of Faith or no?</hi> This queſtion is of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; I ſhall briefly ſpeak ſomething to it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Negatively, To pray in Faith, is not for a Soul to be perſwaded and aſſured that the particular thing that I pray for I ſhall have, though many do miſ-apprehend it, and think this is to pray in Faith, to pray with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that I ſhall have the particular thing I pray for; no, there may be a great deluſion in this: as I knew a profeſſor once, a Woman, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151103:100"/> I hope a godly Woman, ſhe was carried away with this deluſion and conceit, <hi>I know,</hi> ſaies ſhe, <hi>that I ſhall have this thing, and the other thing; I know I ſhall have my Father and Mother come to me from another Country; why, ſaid the Party to her? why,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the promiſe is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ask in Prayer, believing, I ſhall receive, and,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I have Prayed for it, and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall have it.</hi> They perſwaded her it was but a deceit; <hi>no, no,</hi> ſaies ſhe, <hi>I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of it.</hi> But a ſhort time after ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a frenzy and madneſs; but yet ſhe recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again afterward, and I hope ſhe was a godly woman, poſſibly yet living; but I ſpeak of it for this, to ſhew you that this is not to pray in Faith, to be aſſured that what I pray for ſhall be given me; a Man or Woman poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may not have the thing they pray for, or may not have a perſwaſion of the thing to be granted, and yet may pray in Faith. I pray did not our Lord Chriſt himſelf pray that the Cup might paſs from him? And did not he pray in Faith? and was not he heard? <hi>Father I thank thee,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that thou heareſt me always, John</hi> 11.46. He prayed that the Cup might paſs from him, he had not the particular thing that he Prayed for, and yet he was heard, and did pray in Faith for all that; ſo that, I ſay, people may delude themſelves, and think this is to pray in Faith, when we are perſwaded that we ſhall have the paritcular thing granted we pray for; no, this is not to pray in Faith; a man may pray in Faith, though
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151103:100"/> the thing be not granted at preſent; nay, though it never be granted. You will ſay then, How ſhall I know whether I pray in Faith or no, though the thing be never granted that I pray for? I ſhall briefly ſpeak three or four things to this, and ſo wind up all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, Obſerve I pray, when the Heart is brought to be ſubject to the Will of God, and to ſubmit to his diſpoſe; when the Heart is brought after Prayer, or upon Prayer, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Will of God, poſſibly the Soul hath met with ſome great Croſs and affliction, or ſome great loſs, poſſibly of a near and dear Relation, the Soul it may be is mightily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about it, and now goes to God in Prayer, and commits its ſelf and its caſe to God by Prayer, and poſſibly now the Soul is made to ſubmit to the Will of God, the Soul comes to argue and reaſon thus: The Lord is wiſer than I, and the Lord hath an abſolute power over me, and he may do every thing, and it is fit that his Will ſhould be done, and hereby the Heart comes to be quiet and made ſubmiſſive to the Will of God; this argues now, that the Soul hath been praying in Faith, and God hath heard his Prayer, though he give him not the particular thing he prays for; yet he is made to ſubmit to the Will of God. This was juſt the caſe of Chriſt, Chriſt prayed that the Cup might paſs from him, the Cup did not paſs from him, yet in his Prayer he was brought to ſubmit to the Will of God, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> So
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151103:101"/> poſſibly the Soul could not be ſatisfied with the diſpenſation of God, he comes and commends himſelf and his caſe to the Lord, and upon Prayer the Soul is brought to ſubmit to the Will of God, and to ſay, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> This is the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Soul is brought into a compoſed frame upon Prayer, poſſibly the Soul was all in a hurry and royl, before it met with ſomething that was matter of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and perplexity, and it was like the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea, the Soul could not reſt night nor day; well, when this Soul comes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits its ſelf, and caſe, and condition to the Lord in Prayer, and now there is a great calm and quiet in the heart, and all is allayed on a ſudden; here is now the Power of Faith, the ſpirit of Faith hath prevailed, and God hath come in and anſwered that Prayer, tho' not in the ſame kind and way that the Soul deſired; yet it is a ſign it is a Prayer of Faith, and God hath anſwered it, becauſe now the heart is quieted and compoſed after ſuch a ſtorm. This was the caſe of <hi>Hannah, Hannah</hi> was in a royle at firſt, when ſhe was upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for barrenneſs; ſhe goes and commends her Caſe to the Lord; before ſhe told <hi>Ely,</hi> ſhe was a woman of a troubled ſpirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15, <hi>I have drunk neither wine nor ſtrong drink, but have poured out my ſoul before the Lord.</hi> And when ſhe had gone before the Ark, and commended her ſelf and caſe to the Lord by Prayer, it is ſaid, at <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. That
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151103:101"/> 
               <hi>ſhe went her way, and did eat, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad.</hi> And ſo likewiſe this was <hi>David</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s caſe, <hi>David</hi> was exceedingly troubled, and perplexed, and diſquieted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſickneſs of his Child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. He faſted and prayed earneſtly a long time; and though the Child died, yet <hi>David</hi>'s ſpirit was calm and compoſed; and when he heard the Child was dead, then he anointed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. and went into the Houſe of the Lord and worſhipped, and he went alſo into his own Houſe, and did eat and drink as he uſed to do, to the wonderment of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about him; God had compoſed his heart, and though he had not the thing he prayed for, yet he had his Prayer anſwered, and his Prayer was a prayer of Faith.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will ſay, <hi>May not another that hath no faith at all, pray and find his ſpirit quiet? how is this then the work of faith? one that never had any faith at all, poſſibly he may pray and have his ſpirit quiet, and is never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at all; wherein lies the difference?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mark, I pray, ſuch a one that is not at all troubled about his condition, he is after Prayer juſt as he was before.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, this is an evidence that Faith hath been at work upon the heart, namely, when the ſpirit was all in a royle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion like the raging Sea, and then upon Prayer it is calmed and quieted, this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that this Prayer is a prayer of Faith.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:151103:102"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is an argument that a Soul prays in Faith, when as the Soul is made to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Prayer, notwithſtanding the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and difficulties it meets withal: for this is the proper work and effect of Faith, to go on againſt diſcouragements; and not to be taken off by difficulties. As now, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had the bloody Iſſue, ſhe would fain have come to Chriſt, but ſhe met with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, there was a great throng about him that ſhe could not tell how to get near him; but her Faith did carry her on againſt all the diſcouragements and impediments that ſhe met withal; ſhe would preſs into the throng, and if ſhe could but touch the Garment of Chriſt, ſhe would be ſatisfied; the throng ſhould not keep her from Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.28. And ſo the blind man, in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.46, &amp;c. that ſate by the way-ſide begging, he heard that Jeſus was paſſing by, and he cryed out, <hi>Jeſus, thou ſon of David, have mercy on me;</hi> and he made ſuch a noiſe that the people were offended at him, and charged him to hold his peace; and it is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. That he cried out a great deal more, and Chriſt took notice of his Prayer, and called him to him, and ſaid, <hi>What wilt thou, that I ſhould do to thee?</hi> verſe 51. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I might receive my ſight. Go thy way,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> It was a prayer of Faith, and Chriſt did hear it, and he was kept on praying againſt diſcouragements and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments that he met with. And ſo the woman
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:151103:102"/> of <hi>Cannaan</hi> came to Chriſt for her Daughter, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. ſhe intreats Chriſt to have Mercy upon her, Chriſt turns a deaf ear to her, and and anſwers her never a word; ſhe goes on ſtill, and Chriſt denies her, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Here was diſcouragement upon diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſhe goes on ſtill, and ſays Chriſt, <hi>It is not meet to take the Childrens bread and caſt it to dogs.</hi> Yet ſhe would not be diſcouraged, but went on till ſhe had obtained the Mercy. So, I ſay, when a Soul is drawn out to go on in Prayer, notwithſtanding diſcouragements, and objections, and temptations to the contrary, it is an argument that it is a Prayer of Faith, and God will hear it, and anſwer it in his own time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I might have added a fourth, which is this, namely, when a Soul is made to wait upon God ſtill, for an anſwer and return of his Prayer, though the Soul have not yet an anſwer, and doth not meet with a return, yet notwithſtanding, the Soul is made to wait and to go on in waiting, to wait and to perſevere in waiting, truly this is an argument that that Prayer is a prayer of Faith; when the Soul is made willing to wait the Lords time, and the Lords way for an anſwer of that he prays for and expects, this is an argument of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith. Says <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord had promiſed him to give him the Kingdom; <hi>Saul</hi> was then alive, and he ſought <hi>David</hi>'s life; <hi>David</hi> ſometimes had <hi>Saul</hi> at an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:151103:103"/> as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. and one of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies that was with him, ſaid to him, at <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day; now, therefore, let me ſmite him, I pray thee with the ſpear, even to the earth at once,</hi> &amp;c. No, ſays <hi>David,</hi> ſtay the Lords time, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.10, 11. <hi>Deſtroy him not. As the Lord liveth the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to dye; or he ſhall deſcend into battel and periſh. The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth mine hand againſt the Lords annointed.</hi> And ſo for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of danger, Faith doth help a Soul to go on, to perſevere in waiting for it till the Lords time. Says <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto me, and heard my cry; he brought me up alſo out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet upon a rock.</hi> Here was a prayer of Faith, he was willing to wait the Lords time, and the Lord did hear him: And thus now you ſee here are ſome ſymptoms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may diſcern whether we pray in Faith or no. Now, Brethren, you have heard this particular thing ſpoken to, namely, how we ſhould ſo pray in Faith, that our prayers may be pleaſing unto God. What ſhall we think then of thoſe that do not pray at all? Nay, what may they think of themſelves? if thoſe that pray and do not exerciſe Faith do not pleaſe God, what do thoſe do then that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect prayer, that caſt off prayer, and reſtrain prayer? or elſe do it by fits and ſtarts, when they have nothing elſe to do? They reſtrain
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151103:103"/> Family-Prayer, and Cloſet-Prayer, what ſhall we think of them? do theſe pleaſe God? or do they not go on in a way of diſpleaſing God from day to day, provoking the Lord to pour out his wrath upon them? If there be any ſuch here, let them not go on any longer thus to provoke the Lord. But, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and beloved, now that we have heard theſe directions about praying in Faith, let none of us ſatisfie our ſelves with the hearing of theſe things, but let us now endeavour to walk according to the Directions preſented before us. Do you not deſire to pleaſe God in your praying, or elſe what do you pray for? Well, would you not have your Prayers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God day by day? then be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to pray in Faith; and to that end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe Directions that I have now laid before you: And thus now I have done with this particular concerning praying in Faith.</p>
            <p>It remains that we give you ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about exerciſing Faith in hearing of the Word, and then to ſhew you how to partake of the Lords-Supper in Faith, and then I may ſpeak ſomething by way of direction, how we may exerciſe Faith in the buſineſſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this life, in the matters of our particular calling; for every thing muſt be done in Faith: <hi>For without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>

            <p>This is the Subject we have been about, and ſhall now, through the Lords aſſiſtance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in. The laſt time I gave you ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how we ſhould exerciſe Faith in Prayer, ſo as we may pleaſe God; I ſhall now, through the Lords aſſiſtance, proceed, and come to lay down ſome directions, how we may come to exerciſe Faith in hearing the Word of God, that ſo we may pleaſe God: For though we ſhould hear the Word of the Lord never ſo often, yet if we do not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in our hearing, we do not pleaſe God in it. It is not enough that a man or woman have Faith in the habit, the Grace of Faith in his heart, whileſt he is hearing the Word, but it is requiſite unto our pleaſing of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:151103:104"/> God in hearing his Word, that we act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Faith. Says the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached, as well as unto them; but the word preached did not profit them.</hi> Why not? why did not the Word Preached profit them? He gives this as the Reaſon of it, <hi>not being mixed with faith,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in them that heard it.</hi> They did not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in hearing the Word, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did not profit by hearing, for want of mixing Faith with it: The word that is tranſlated <hi>mixed,</hi> it ſignifies an incorporation, or a Compoſition, as it were, as there is in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ingredients into a Potion. As now, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in a Potion, if there want ſome ſpecial ingredient that is requiſite to it, the Potion will do little good, nay, poſſibly it may do a great deal of hurt, it may not only not profit, but it may prejudice, it may be very hurtful. Truly, ſo this Faith is a ſpecial ingredient to our hearing the Word of God; now, if this be wanting, this acting and exerciſing of Faith in hearing the Word, we may be much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced; it is of great concernment for people to be acting and exerciſing of Faith in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word. I do not deny, but God may ſometimes, and doth ordinarily by the Word work Faith in thoſe that were not Believers before; for <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we cannot ſay, though God may pleaſe to work Faith in thoſe that have no Faith, by hearing the Word, yet we cannot
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:151103:105"/> ſay that their hearing the Word that have no Faith, is pleaſing unto God, or that they do pleaſe God in their hearing; no, the Text ſeems to ſpeak the contrary; the Text ſays, that <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And truly this may be the great wound, the great ſore upon people, the great impediment and hindrance, and reaſon why people hear much, and profit ſo little, for want of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Faith in hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay then, <hi>How ſhall we ſo act and exerciſe faith in our hearing the word, that our hearing may be pleaſing unto God, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this, I ſhall come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to lay down ſome Directions about hearing the Word of the Lord in a way of Faith, that ſo our hearing the Word may be pleaſing unto God:</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, we muſt be ſure of this, to be perſwaded upon good grounds, that thoſe that we do hear diſpenſing the Word be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent by Chriſt to Preach, or elſe we cannot hear them in Faith; ſome may Preach, and yet were never ſent, as the Lord ſaith in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied.</hi> A man may come that hath good parts, and Preach the Word, and yet may not be ſent by the Lord; and if he be not ſent by the Lord, truly then we cannot hear in Faith; and if we be not perſwaded that he is ſent by Chriſt, and called by Chriſt to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:151103:105"/> Preach and diſpenſe the Goſpel, we cannot depend upon it as an Ordinance of God, we cannot expect the preſence of Chriſt, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect the bleſſing of Chriſt upon his Preaching. There are Two things therefore that we are to attend to here:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That thoſe that we hear Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, be ſent and called by Chriſt to Preach. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt be perſwaded that they are ſent and called by Chriſt to Preach, or elſe we cannot hear them in Faith; if we be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are called and ſent by Chriſt. What the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning eating of meats, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. he would have people perſwaded in their minds; for ſays he, <hi>He that doubteth,</hi> or he that queſtions whether it be lawful or no, he <hi>is damned if he eat.</hi> That is, he ventures upon a ſin that does deſerve damnation. So, in this caſe, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we be not perſwaded that ſuch a one that we hear, be ſent by Chriſt, we cannot hear the Word in Faith. And to this purpoſe, I pray conſider that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they Preach except they be ſent?</hi> Sent by whom? by Chriſt, they muſt be called and ſent by Chriſt. How can we hear them except they be ſent? Why, cannot we hear a man except he be ſent? No, not lawfully; we cannot
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151103:106"/> hear him in Faith, if we be not perſwaded that he is ſent by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will ſay, <hi>Suppoſe now that one that hath parts and abilities come and Preach the Truth, that which is ſound Doctrine, may we not hear him? is it not lawful to hear him? Is it not ſufficient if he be a man of abilities, and do Preach ſound Doctrine? what ſhall we need to ſcruple to hear him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer, Suppoſe now that an Idolatrous Maſs-Prieſt ſhould come and Preach ſound Doctrine, Orthodox Truths to a people, do you think now that ſuch a one is ſent by Chriſt? do you think that you may ſtand law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and attend upon his miniſtry as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, not being ſent by Chriſt? Nay, I will ſay further, The Devil himſelf may Preach the Truth, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not being ſent by Chriſt, we are not to hear him. In <hi>Luke</hi> 4.33, 34. the Devil there he would be Preaching of Chriſt, what he ſaid was Truth, <hi>I know thee who thou art, the Holy one of God.</hi> But Chriſt would not ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er him, in verſ. 35. <hi>And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, hold thy Peace.</hi> He would ſilence him, this is that which poſſibly very few have minded in former times, but have gone on in hearing one and other without making any Queſtion whether they were ſent by Chriſt or no; but I ſay, we cannot act in Faith if we ſhould go on thus, if we be not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are called and ſent by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay further, <hi>How can poor
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:151103:106"/> weak People, that are weak in underſtanding, how can they diſcern and underſtand whether Miniſters be called and ſent by Chriſt or no?</hi> Alas! this is a hard thing for us to diſcern, and therefore it is ſomewhat too hard to impoſe upon us, that we muſt be perſwaded that they are ſent by Chriſt, or elſe we cannot lawfully hear them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Brethren, I ſuppoſe it is not ſo hard and difficult a thing to know whether a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be ſent by Chriſt or no; briefly thus, Chriſt he ordinarily ſends one of theſe two ways, thoſe whom he would have to Preach in his name, either</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a way of inſtitution or appointment in the way of his Ordinance; namely thus, when a Church of Chriſt following the Rules and Directions that Chriſt doth give in his Word, doth chuſe and call ſuch a one that is ſo and ſo qualified, and in ſuch a way, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Rules ſet him a-part for the work of Chriſt; this is now according to Chriſts inſtitution and Ordinance, here is one that is called by Chriſt to Preach and diſpenſe the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another way whereby Chriſt may alſo call, namely, a providential way, in the way of his Providence, when as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple finding and diſcerning a perſon qualified and gifted for ſuch a work, do thereupon call him and deſire him to Preach to them; here is now a providential call, and Chriſt by this Providence doth call him, and ſend him,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:151103:107"/> as we read in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. <hi>Paul,</hi> there, <hi>went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſynagogue on the ſabbath-day, and ſet down, and after the reading of the Law and of the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on.</hi> Here was now a providential call, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the people. So, ſays the Apoſtle, in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. when he was doubtful which way to go to Preach, at <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7. they would have gone to this place, and the other, but the ſpirit hindred them. At laſt, at <hi>v.</hi> 9.10. <hi>A viſion appeared to Paul in the night, and there ſtood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Come over into Macedonia and help us. And after he had ſeen the viſion, immediately we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to go into Macedonia, aſſuredly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, that the Lord had called us to preach the Goſpel unto them.</hi> Why, here was a beck of providence, and here was a call by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God did diſcover it in a Viſion; ſo that one of theſe two ways God doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily now adays call Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel. Now, this is eaſie to be diſcerned, and therefore we are to be fully perſwaded in our minds, that ſuch as we go to hear, are called and ſent by Chriſt to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or elſe we cannot attend upon it as an Ordinance of Chriſt, nor expect the bleſſing of Chriſt upon it.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will ſay further, <hi>But have not good Chriſtians heretofore, godly people, been wont to attend upon ſuch as did Preach ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:151103:107"/> without queſtioning their call? They never douhted whether they were ſent by Chriſt or no; but heard them, and the Lord was pleaſed alſo to bleſs their hearing, that they profited by their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore why ſhould we need to ſcruple and queſtion whether we may not hear one as well as another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Brethren, for this, I may ſay as the Apoſtle ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. The times of this ignorance God winked at, when he ſuffered them to go on in their erroneus ways: in times of ignorance God winketh at: But now, ſays he, he commandeth all men every where to repent and reform. So now, there being a further light, though God might wink at former ignorance, yet now he calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all to conſider and underſtand whom they hear, and what they hear, and upon what grounds thoſe that come to Preach the Goſpel to us, come; we know that in point of worſhip there are many things that were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore practiced by the people of God; and yet notwithſtanding their former practiſes, do not make thoſe things to be lawful to us now; as there were many things about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order of the Church that formerly Chriſtians have yielded too, and yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo freely and ſo ſafely with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience yield to them; and though good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have formerly yielded to them, yet that doth not make it to be warrantable and lawful for us. But in a word, do we believe? are we perſwaded that whatſoever is not of Faith
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:151103:108"/> is ſin? If we be not fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of a thing, and yet do it, it is ſin? And do we believe what the Text ſaith here, That <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God?</hi> Then if ſo be that we have not Faith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that ſuch as do Preach are ſent by Chriſt, then I think we cannot act Faith in hearing the Word from them. This is the firſt Direction about hearing in Faith, namely, that we be perſwaded that thoſe that we do hear be called and ſent by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Direction how to act Faith in hearing the Word, is this, namely, we ſhould be careful to remove all impediments that may hinder us in our hearing, from enjoying the preſence of Chriſt, and our profiting by the Word; for this is the work of Faith, to put us upon the uſe of all lawful means to attain an end; Faith will not expect the end but upon the uſe of means. And ſo on the other ſide, as it is the work of Faith to put us upon the uſe of means for the attaining of the end, ſo to avoid all the impediments and hindrances that lye in the way to the attaining of the end; when the Lord called <hi>Jacob</hi> to go to <hi>Bethel, Gen.</hi> 35.1, 2, 3. that he might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God there; now, <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he might enjoy the Preſence of God, and Communion with God in <hi>Bethel,</hi> in his drawing near to God there, <hi>Jacob</hi> he removes impediments; now he calls upon his houſhold and all that were with him to put away the ſtrange gods from among them, <hi>and be clean,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and change
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:151103:108"/> your garments; and let us ariſe and go up to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and I will make an Alter unto God,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> God gave order to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the people ſhould be ſanctified and purified when they ſhould come to draw near to God, and God ſhould draw near to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10, 11. And ſo now, when we are to draw near to God in the hearing of his Word, we are to be careful to remove all impediments that may hinder our profiting by our hearing; and this is the work of Faith, Faith doth ſet a Soul a work to endeavour to remove all impediments. Now there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers impediments to be removed, which will certainly hinder our profiting by the Word, I ſhall name ſome few ſpecial ones which the Scripture hints to us: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is one, Malice in the heart; to have the heart poſſeſſed with Malice towards one or another, this will hinder us from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting by the Word. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſly calleth upon us, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, if you harbor malice in your hearts when you come to hear the Word, you will not grow and profit by it; if you entertain and allow malice in your hearts towards one another, this malice may break out in the envy of the good, and welfare of another; and ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle brings in that branch of <hi>malice, envy,</hi> and ſometimes it breaks out in reviling and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:151103:109"/> evil-ſpeaking, and therefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Lay aſide all malice, and envy, and evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo receive the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> As in Prayer, if I regard iniquity in my heart God will not hear my Prayer; ſo in this caſe, if we allow any ſin in our hearts, any malice towards one or another, when we come to hear the Word, God will not liſten to us, and we ſhall not profit by the Word: this may be one cauſe why people hear ſo much, and profit ſo little. If ſo be they do allow malice and envy in their hearts, and allow themſelves to ſpeak evil of others, they cannot hear the Word to grow and profit by it; no, we are to exerciſe love in our drawing near to God, love to God, and love to the Word, and love to the Saints, and love to one another; for if ſo be that we do not love them that we have ſeen or do ſee, ſays the Apoſtle, how can we be truly ſaid to love God whom we have not ſeen? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. Therefore this is one thing, Let us be careful to lay aſide all malice, and envy, and evil-ſpeaking, if we do deſire ſo to draw near to God in the hearing of the Word, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another impediment that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath in the ſame place of <hi>Peter,</hi> is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and guile; this alſo muſt be laid aſide, or elſe we ſhall not receive the Word, ſo as to grow and profit by it; if we come to the hearing of the Word, and do maintain guile and hypocriſy in our hearts, and allow of it,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:151103:109"/> then we cannot profit or grow by the Word. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth plainly hold forth, that all guile and hypocriſy muſt be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſo receive the Word, as new born babes, that ye may grow thereby. Guile and hypocriſy doth hinder our profiting by the Word; for this is now a kind of ſtumbling-block, we draw near to God, and have a ſtumbling-block in our hearts; and ſays the Lord, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.7. <hi>If any man ſetteth up Idols in his heart, and putteth the ſtumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to enquire of him concerning me, I, the Lord, will anſwer that man by my ſelf.</hi> Some do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that place, the word <hi>ſtumbling-block,</hi> for the ſeparating and withdrawing the heart from God. Now there are two kinds of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy or guile that are to be laid aſide in hearing the Word, one is in reſpect of God, the other is towards man; the guile and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy towards God is this, namely, when as a man or woman doth ſeem to draw near to God in his worſhip, attending upon his Word, and yet notwithſtanding the heart is not near God, but afar off from him, here is hypocriſy and diſſimulation towards God; <hi>This people,</hi> ſays God, <hi>draw near to me with their mouth and lips, but their heart is far from me,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. And ſo Chriſt tells the Scribes and Phariſees, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.8. when as a man doth pretend to draw near to God, as if he would know the Mind of God, that he may do the Will of God, and have no ſuch intendment in his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:151103:110"/> heart, he comes to hear the Word, what doth this hold forth, but that he intends to do the word which he hears? Now, when the heart is not ſet to do the Will of God, here is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. I remember <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks to that purpoſe, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.20. <hi>For ye diſſembled in your hearts,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when ye ſent me unto the Lord your God, ſaying, pray for us unto the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay to us, we will do it.</hi> Your heart was not right, ſays he, ye pretended, and ſaid, <hi>whatever the Lord our God ſhall ſay, we will do,</hi> but ye did diſſemble. This is one kind of hypocriſy and guile, when a Soul doth diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God, and ſeem to worſhip God, and yet the heart is far from God; pretend to come to know the Mind of God, and yet have not a full purpoſe and reſolution of heart to do what God ſhall reveal and make known to be his Will. And then there is another kind of hypocriſy and guile, which is towards men; when as a man doth pretend love to his Neighbour, and kindneſs and friendſhip in Word and Lip, and yet there is no reality at all in the heart. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of this very thing, ſays he, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>My little Children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi> It is not a love in deed and in truth, when as our Brother or Neighbour ſtand in need of ſupply and help, and we ſhut up our bowels towards him; here is diſſembling, we pretend love, and there is no reality. Now, ſays the Apoſtle, if you
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:151103:110"/> will hear the Word ſo as to profit by it, you muſt lay aſide all guile and hypocriſy; this may be another great cauſe and reaſon why people do come and hear much, and profit little, becauſe they harbour guile and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in their hearts; therefore this you muſt be careful alſo to lay aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another impediment which the Holy-Ghoſt alſo points at in Scripture, which doth hinder us from profiting by the Word, is this, when we come to hear with our hearts royled with paſſion, and anger, and wrath; when we come to hear, and have our ſpirits in a ſtorm as it were with paſſion, then we may hear and hear, but ſhall not profit by our hearing; for now the heart and ſpirit is like a joynt or bone out of the Socket, now it hath no ability to act its part, to do what lay upon ſuch a Member to do. So 'tis in this caſe, when the heart and ſpirit is in a royle, it is put out of joynt and frame by paſſion; and being diſturbed, now 'tis unfit to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, to hear what God ſhall ſpeak. Now a mans paſſion may be diſturbed one of theſe two ways, ſo as to be put out of frame to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon God, to hear the Voice of God in his Word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes by ſome pinching Providence of God, ſome afflicting Hand of God upon him, which doth pinch and diſturb the ſpirit, and put it into a royle; now a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being thus diſturbed in his ſpirit, is unfit to hear what God ſpeaks, though he ſpeak to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:151103:111"/> him in a way of mercy and grace; you have an inſtance for this, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And Moſes ſpake ſo unto the Children of Iſrael, but they hearkned not unto Moſes.</hi> How did he ſpeak to the Children of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> See <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Wherefore ſay unto the Children of Iſrael, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of the Egyptians, and will rid you out of their bondage, and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord your God, which brought you out from under the burden of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and I will bring you in unto the land which I did ſware to give it to Abraham, to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it you for an heritage; I am the Lord. And Moſes ſpake ſo unto the Children of Iſrael: but they hearkned not unto Moſes, for anguiſh of ſpirit, and for cruel bondage.</hi> Through the Providence of God it came to paſs, that they were oppreſſed under <hi>Egyptian</hi> power; and when <hi>Moſes</hi> came to ſpeak of inlargement and deliverance, they were oppreſſed, and their ſpirits were filled with anguiſh and trouble; and now let the Lord ſpeak in never ſuch a gracious manner by his Prophet, they could not attend to him for anguiſh of ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo ſometimes the ſpirit may be put into a royle and paſſion for ſome ſmall petty croſs, ſome kind of vexation which others do occaſion, when they croſs them and vex them, and thereby their ſpirits are put out of order; and now they are unfit to attend upon God:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:151103:111"/> You have an inſtance for this, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6, 7. concerning <hi>Hannah,</hi> it is ſaid there, that <hi>her adverſary provoked her ſore, for to make her fret, becauſe the Lord had ſhut up her womb;</hi> and ſhe went up to the Houſe of the Lord, and ſhe wept and did not eat, ſhe could not tell how to keep the Feaſt, to wait upon God in his Ordinances; Why? becauſe her ſpirit was vexed and did fret. So you may obſerve it, if your ſpirits be put out of order, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are upon a ſmall occaſion, obſerve it, the Devil is wont to take ſuch opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when you are about to draw near to God in any Ordinance, then to miniſter ſome occaſion or other to put you into a fret; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a little thing out of the way will do it, ſometimes the miſplacing of a Pin will diſturb the ſpirit, and ſometimes the Husband may take ſome offence againſt the Wife, and the Wife againſt the Husband, or againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Children, and the Spirit is royled, and now you come to hear, you ſhall not profit, becauſe now your ſpirits are royled with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and this is another impediment, and here may be alſo one great reaſon why peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come and hear, and hear, and profit little, becauſe many times their ſpirits are royled with paſſion, and this alſo muſt be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another Impediment that muſt be removed, if you will hear the Word to profit, then take heed that your hearts do not go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covetouſneſs, be not inordinately ſet upon the riches of this world, bent and reſolved to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:151103:112"/> be rich in the world, truly this will be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, and will hinder you from waiting upon God in his Word; this will be like Thorns to choke the Word; for now the Word is that which doth croſs and thwart us in our reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es after the riches of the world. The Word tells us of other riches that are more true Riches; now, when a mans heart is ſet upon the riches of the world, he cannot then yield to what is ſpoken; juſt like the rich man we read of in <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. The rich man comes to Chriſt to know what good thing he ſhall do to inherit eternal life; <hi>Go,</hi> ſays Chriſt, in <hi>ver.</hi> 21.22. <hi>ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven:</hi> And it is ſaid, he went away ſorrowful, becauſe this was contrary to his grain; his mind and heart was ſet upon riches, and he could not yield to this Word of Chriſt. And our hearts are ready to ſcorn, and ſlight, and deſpiſe what is ſpoken, if our hearts be ſet upon the riches of the world; as you may read in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.14. 'tis ſaid there, when Chriſt was warning them to take heed of the world, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> The Phariſees who were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, heard all theſe things, and they deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, this was againſt the grain, their hearts were covetous, and ſet upon the riches of the world; and now whatever Chriſt ſpeaks, they deſpiſe and ſet at nought. This is that which the Holy-Ghoſt doth warn us againſt, and doth ſhew us that this is the great ground and cauſe why people hear the Word and profit
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:151103:112"/> not, becauſe their hearts go after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32. ſays the Lord there, <hi>This people cometh unto thee as the people cometh, and ſit before thee as my people, and they hear my words, and they ſeem to be pleaſing to them, and they take delight in them, and thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and they hear thy words, and do them not;</hi> why ſo? <hi>for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their hearts goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> Their hearts goeth after the world, and therefore whatever is ſpoken will do them no good; and therefore Chriſt doth admoniſh us and adviſe us to take heed and beware of covetouſneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. Well, this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impediment; if we do deſire to hear the Word to profit and edification, let us get our hearts off from the riches of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To name no more, Take heed alſo of having the heart filled with the cares and matters of this world; if our hearts be filled with the world, there will be no room for the Word to take place: Juſt as if a Room be filled and taken up, there is no room for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to come in. If the world, and buſineſs, and occaſions of the world come and take up the head and the heart, here will be no room for the Word to take place; it is juſt as it is in a great croud, where there is a great noiſe; if there be a great noiſe in the Street, if one come and ſpeak a word in your ear, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear him becauſe of the noiſe; ſo if our hearts and ears be filled with the cares and the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:151103:113"/> buſineſs of the world, it makes ſuch a noiſe as we cannot hear; and therefore Chriſt tells us, that theſe cares of the world are like Thorns, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.22. <hi>He that receiveth ſeed among thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choak the Word, and he becometh unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Though we hear much, and there be much Seed ſown, yet if it ſpring up among Thorns, it will never come to any maturity; and therefore hence it is, that Chriſt by two Parables doth ſhew us how the occaſions and buſineſſes of the world doth hinder people from liſtening to the voice of Chriſt in his Word, in <hi>Luke</hi> 14. There is one Parable of a great Supper that a great man made, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited many, but they refuſed to come, and made light of it. And the other Parable you have in <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.5. concerning a King which made a Marriage Feaſt for his Son, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited his Gueſts, and when the Feaſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared they made light of it, and would not come; What was the Reaſon? One muſt go to his Farm, and another to his Merchandiſe; one about this buſineſs, and another about that, and they could not attend to the Lords Voice in his Word. Chriſt doth thereby ſhew us, that the matters and cares of this world, when they fill the head and the heart, they do hinder us from attending upon God in his Word: This is now another impediment which is to be removed, if we would ſo attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word, as to hear it with profit. And
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:151103:113"/> truly Brethren, to ſpeak plainly, I am afraid that this is one great cauſe why many do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo little by hearing the Word; they come reeking out of the world, and their hands, and heads, and hearts are full of the world, and by that means the Word comes to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to them. Oh! that we could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learn to underſtand the Lords Will, to underſtand what are the impediments that hinder us from hearing the Word with profit, and be careful to get them removed: This is the ſecond Direction, how to hear the Word in a way of Faith. Faith doth put us upon the removing thoſe impediments that do hinder us from profiting by the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Third Direction is this; If we would hear the Word in a way of Faith, ſo as we may profit by it, it is to hear it as the very Word of God, as if God ſhould ſpeak from Heaven to us immediately; How would we hear the Word if God ſhould ſpeak to us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Heaven? with what reverence and attention would you hear? how would you be careful to ſwallow up every Word that God ſhould ſpeak? Brethren, know this, that God out of tenderneſs and reſpect to us, ſpeaks in another manner and way to us now, inſtrumentally by man, more mediately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not able to bear the immediate Voice of God; as they ſaid at Mount <hi>Sinai, Let not God ſpeak any more to us, for we cannot bear it.</hi> Now, the Lord, out of indulgency to us, becauſe we cannot bear his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:151103:114"/> voice, the Lord is pleaſed to ſpeak to us by means and inſtruments, by men that are like our ſelves; now, I ſay, it is God that ſpeaks to us by men, it is God that ſpeaks from Heaven to us by men; therefore we are to hear the Word, as if God from Heaven did ſpeak to us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Take heed that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaks from Heaven.</hi> This is the way now to profit by the Word, and to hear it in Faith; you ſhall find that <hi>Cornelius</hi> he heard in this manner, when <hi>Peter</hi> came to Preach to him, <hi>Cornelius</hi> attended to him, as if God himſelf ſpoke to him, in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. <hi>Now, therefore are we all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God;</hi> as if we ſhould hear God himſelf ſpeak. And you ſee what the advantage and benefit of it was; it is ſaid in <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. that <hi>while Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy-Ghoſt fell on all them that heard him.</hi> By this means the Word was made profitable and effectual to them, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard it;</hi> as if God himſelf had ſpoken to them. And the like you read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>For this cauſe thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> Ye received it not as the word of man, though it was ſpoken by man; but ye heard it as the very Word of God, as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:151103:114"/> if God himſelf ſpake from Heaven to you; and therefore Brethren, mind this, when we come to hear the Word, we ſhould attend upon it, and hear it as the very Word of God, as if God himſelf did ſpeak from Heaven, and ſo receive it.</p>
            <p>Object. But you will ſay, <hi>What, ſhall we receive every thing that is Preached by Miniſters, as the very Word of God? Indeed if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, we might; but men are not infallable in their Preaching, as the Apoſtles were; they are but men, and they may err and miſtake ſometimes; now, are we bound to receive every thing from them as if God himſelf did ſpeak it? Miniſters alſo</hi> (you will ſay) <hi>may differ ſometimes in their teaching, one man is of one opinion, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man of another opinion, what, are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatever one and another ſpeak, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word of God? as if God ſpoke to us? how can this be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to this, briefly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, therefore it doth concern Miniſters of the Goſpel to take very great heed, that whatever they ſpeak, it be according to the Mind and Will of God, to ſpeak nothing of their own heads, but what they have warrant for from the Word; and therefore we ſhould uſually back what we hold forth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for matter of Doctrine to be believed, or for matter to be practiſed from the Word of God; we ſhould be very careful of that, ſo that we may be able to ſay, as the Apoſtle did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>For I delivered unto you
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:151103:115"/> firſt of all, that which I alſo received,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ſhould we do. And let me tell you, I confeſs it hath been matter of ſome trouble to me, fearing leſt I ſhould ſometimes ſpeak what I have not warrant for from the Lords mouth, to hold forth according to his Will; It hath made me ſometimes (to tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to wiſh that I were otherwiſe imployed, and that the Lord might imploy thoſe that might more fully declare, and hold forth his Mind and Counſel to the people, than poſſibly I may be able to do; but this is that that lyes incumbent upon Miniſters, to be very careful to hold forth nothing but what they have warrant for from the Word of God. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe what is held forth and delivered ſometimes by Miniſters be not expreſly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word, yet notwithſtanding we ſhould be very backward and ſlow to reject and deſpiſe what is held forth, though we do not ſee at preſent what warrant there is for it in the Word; poſſibly it may be according to the Mind of Chriſt in a conſequential way, it may be reduced from the Word. And thus far further we ſhould do, we ſhould be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inquiring whether thoſe things be ſo or no? like the <hi>Bereans,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. It is ſaid, that they were more noble than thoſe in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> for they received the Word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched into the Scriptures dayly, to ſee whether thoſe things were ſo or no. The <hi>Bereans,</hi> when they heard <hi>Paul</hi> Preach ſomething poſſibly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:151103:115"/> that they did not ſo well apprehend to be grounded upon the Scriptures, they did not thereupon ſlight and deſpiſe what they heard, but here was matter of further inquiry for them, they ſearched the Scriptures to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was according to the Scriptures or no; and they were commended for it: ſo ſhould we do, if any thing be held forth that we cannot ſee for the preſent expreſs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ground for in the Scripture, we ſhould not ſlight it and caſt it off, but be ſearching into the Scriptures, to ſee whether there may not be ſome ground and warrant for it; This is the third Direction; if we would hear the Word of God in Faith, we muſt be careful to receive it as the very word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we would hear the Word in Faith, ſo as it may be to profit and edification, we ſhould ſo hear it, as to make a particular application of it to our ſelves, as ſpoken to us in particular; mark it, I pray, here is the direction, we ſhould not only hear the Word, and receive it as ſpoken by the Lord, as if God himſelf ſhould ſpeak to us, but take it as ſpoken to us particularly from the Lord; every one ſhould take it to himſelf as particularly ſpoken to me, and to me in particular; as they ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 5.27. <hi>Lo this, we have ſearched it, ſo it is; hear it, and know it thou for thy good;</hi> for thy good in particular. And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26. <hi>To you is the word of Salvation ſent.</hi> So to you, and to every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:151103:116"/> is this word ſent, and this is the very proper work of Faith, to make a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Word that is ſpoken to its ſelf. This, I ſay, is the proper work of Faith; for you know in Scripture, the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and the word of Promiſe lay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, now it is the very work and act of Faith, to take the word that lies in common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and apply it particularly to the Heart; this is the very proper work of Faith; or elſe Brethren, the word will do us no good; It will be juſt like a Table full of Meat; the Meat will do us no good if it be not taken; ſo long as it ſtands upon the Table it will do us no good, if it be not taken and eaten down, and applied particularly to us. So in this Caſe, ſo long as the Word lies only in the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, the word of Command, or the word of Promiſe, or whatever word it be, if it lie before us as common and in general, and there be no particular application of it, it doth us no good at all, we ſhall not profit by it; but now when it comes particularly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that God ſpeaks this as a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to me, that this is my Duty, and I muſt take it as if God did ſpeak it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to me, that which I am called to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; ſo if it be a word of Promiſe, I ſhould take it as ſpoken from the Lord to me, the Lord calls me to accept of it and embrace it; and, Brethren, though the Word of the Lord ſeems to lay in common, yet it hath an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every perſon that hears it, it looks to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:151103:116"/> one, juſt as a Picture, if it be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn, if there be a Hundred Perſons in the Room, the eye will be upon every one in the Room; ſo the eye of the Word is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every particular perſon, that hears it; and know it for your good, that the Lord doth ſpeak to everyone of us in particular, when the Word is Preached, and we ſhould not ſay, Well, here was a word fit for ſuch a one, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to others, and ſuch a one was met with in the Word: No, no, Brethren, ſo long as we can apply the Word to others and not to our ſelves, it will do us no good; but this is our work and buſineſs, when the Word is Preached in the Name of the Lord, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, we muſt take it as ſpoken to our ſelves; and here is now the act of Faith, to make that particular which is ſpoken in general. This is now a Fourth directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I ſhall name but one more, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If we would hear the Word of God in Faith, ſo as to profit by it, then we ſhould act Faith variouſly, according to the ſeveral kinds or parts of the Word, for you know there are divers parts in the Word; as now, there is a Word of Doctrine, and a Word of Promiſe; ſome are Commands, and ſome are Threatnings; now, I ſay, we ſhould act Faith upon the Word variouſly, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of it; as now for example, if ſo be that we meet with a word of Doctrine, as concerning the Creation of the World that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:151103:117"/> was made out of nothing, or the Reſurrection of the Dead, that every perſon ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again; or concerning the Trinity of perſons in the Godhead, or the union of two natures in one perſon, or our being juſtified by Faith in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are Doctrinal; now, Faith is to be acted here, Namely, by giving our aſſent to the truth thereof, by believing of it as faithful and true. <hi>He that receiveth his Teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal that God is True, John</hi> 3.33. And by Faith we believe that the World was created out of nothing; this is acting of Faith upon this part of the Word, by giving our aſſent to it, and believing of it to be true, becauſe the Lord hath ſpoken it; poſſibly we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, how there ſhould be three perſons in one eſſence, and that the ſame Body ſhall be raiſed again that is mouldered into Duſt; we cannot underſtand the reaſon of it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſpoken it, we ſhould believe it. But then there is another part of the Word that contain Promiſes; now, how ſhould Faith act upon the Promiſes, namely, by leaning and reſting with expectation upon the Lord for the performance of them, being perſwaded that God can do it, and that God will perform what he hath ſpoken; juſt like <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21. God had made him a promiſe to give him a Son in his old Age, Fleſh and Blood would have diſputed againſt this promiſe, but ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>He was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory unto God;</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:151103:117"/> that God would perform what he had ſpoken; it was againſt Fleſh and Blood, <hi>Sarah</hi> was Old, and he was a Hundred years old or there-about; he might have ſaid how can theſe things be? and refuſed to believe it; no, but he gave Glory to God by believing; Thus we are to act Faith upon that part of the Word. Another part of the Word is Commands; The word of Command; how is Faith to act there? Namely, in a way of Obedience; we ſhould yeild Obedience to what God Commands, though it may be very hard to us. Juſt as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did, God commanded him to go out of his own Country, and to go into a Land he knew not whither; <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and went out, not knowing whither he went; and ſo God commanded him to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac; Abraham</hi> acted Faith in a way of Obedience to the Command. And then another part of the Word is Threatning; and how is Faith to act upon the Threatnings? Namely, thus, in a way of fear, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid thoſe Judgements that are threatned; in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith, Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fear prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Truly, thus I ſay, Faith is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And thus, Brethren, I have briefly given you four or five Directions how we are to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in hearing of the Word, that ſo we may not hear without profit, that ſo we may pleaſe God in our hearing; for <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Brethren and Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I muſt not enlarge; but in a word, It hath been the complaint of moſt Chriſtians, and poſſibly ſome here preſent, their want of profiting by the Word; Oh! I hear, and hear, but the Lord knows I do not profit; this is the matter of your complaint; well, now you may go home, and lay your hand upon the Sore, the Lord hath diſcovered to me this day the great Cauſe why I have profited no more under the Word that I have heard ſo often; I ſee now it is for want of the exerciſe of Faith, I have heard my duty, but the Lord knows I have exerciſed Faith but little; and therefore, I ſay, here is matter of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, before the Lord, we ſhould lye low in the preſence of the Lord for our ſo little act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith, in our hearing the Word of God. And, Oh! therefore for the future, as we do deſire that the Lord may be pleaſed with our hearing, ſo let us be careful to exerciſe Faith in our hearing; you have heard the Directions, I ſhall not need to repeat them, but go home and conſider them, and be careful to put them in practice, that you may be acting and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:151103:118"/> exerciſing Faith in hearing the Word, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it will be impoſſible for you to pleaſe God. Though you ſhould hear Sermons never ſo often, if you neglect to act and exerciſe Faith, you will not profit by them, nor pleaſe God in your hearing. And ſo now I have done with this particular, namely, how we are to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Faith in hearing the Word; it remains that we ſhould ſpeak about exerciſing Faith in our partaking of the Lords Table.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words of the Text is a Propoſition: I have ſpent ſome time in the handling of it; we came by way of inference to this, That if it be impoſſible to pleaſe God without Faith, then it doth concern us every one, in all the duties and ſervices that we perform, to be acting and exerciſing of Faith; not only without the Grace of Faith, but without the exerciſe of Faith we cannot pleaſe God; and therefore to this end, we came to lay down ſome Directions, how we may come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Faith in thoſe Duties that we perform, that ſo we may pleaſe God; we gave you ſome Directions the laſt time about the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith in hearing of the Word; I come now to lay down ſome Directions about our partaking of the Lords-Supper in Faith. That Faith is requiſite and neceſſary to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:151103:119"/> of the Lords-Table, that I think is out of doubt and queſtion, not only the habit of Faith that a man or woman be a believer, but alſo the very acting and exerciſe of Faith is requiſite for our profitable partaking of this Ordinance: The Grace of Faith is neceſſary for the giving of us a right to partake of this Ordinance; for a Man muſt have life, or elſe meat will do him no good; ſet the daintieſt meat before him that is dead, he will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit the better for it, the meat cannot nouriſh him; ſo if we have not a principle of ſpiritual life which is infuſed into the heart by Faith in Chriſt, if we have not ſpiritual life, ſpiritual food will do us no good; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be the Grace of Faith.</p>
            <p>Again, This Ordinance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it is a ſealing Ordinance, to ſeal, and confirm, and ratify the Covenant of Grace, and the benefits of the Covenant; now if ſo be we be not in the Covenant, then this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance cannot ſeal to us the bleſſings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant; no, we do but ſet a ſeal to a blank, and that ſignifies nothing; therefore, I ſay, it is neceſſary there ſhould be the Grace of Faith, the habit of Faith, that thoſe that do partake of this Ordinance ſhould be Believers. But this is that which I am to ſpeak to, that though only ſuch as are Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to partake of this Ordinance, yet it is not ſufficient for us that we are Believers; but if we would partake of this Ordinance ſo as to pleaſe God, we muſt act and exerciſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:151103:120"/> Faith alſo about it. For, I pray, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is poſſible for thoſe that are Believers to partake unworthily, to eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, ſays the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> Who doth he ſpeak to there? He writes to Believers: Believers then may eat and drink unworthily. How comes a Soul then to eat and drink worthily? to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take worthily of this Ordinance? Truly, by the acting and exerciſing of Faith; for though he have the habit of Faith, he may partake unworthily. What is the reaſon that divers Believers come to partake of this Ordinance, ſome partake worthily, and ſome unworthily? The reaſon is, becauſe ſome partake in the exerciſe of Faith, and they partake worthily; and ſome partake without the exerciſe of Faith, and they partake unworthily. And mark how the Apoſtle goes on, ſays he, it is requiſite that thoſe that partake at the Lords Table, that they ſhould examine themſelves; <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> verſ. 28. <hi>and ſo let him eat.</hi> Examine himſelf concerning what? why, among other things, about his Faith. What, whether he be a Believer or no? Yes, that is one thing he muſt examine, whether he do truly believe or no; whether he have the grace of Faith or no; but that is not all; ſuppoſe that be out of doubt and queſtion, that he is a Believer, yet he muſt examine himſelf ſtill about the acting and exerciſing of Faith in this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:151103:120"/> Ordinance, and therefore this Duty of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a mans ſelf doth imply that there muſt be an actuating and exerciſing of Faith in the partaking of this Ordinance. Further, ſays the Apoſtle, they that come to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt diſcern the Lords Body, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> (I may ſpeak ſomething by and by concerning that, to help you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that) but for our preſent purpoſe, diſcerning the Lords body, How ſhall a man or woman diſcern the Lords Body? We do not diſcern the Lords Body by our bodily eye, by looking on the Bread and Wine, the outward Elements, but it muſt be by the acting of a ſpiritual eye; and what is that but the eye of Faith? Faith then muſt be acted and exerciſed in this Ordinance, or elſe we do not diſcern the Lords Body; and if we do not diſcern the Lords Body, then we eat and drink unworthily, and ſo do not pleaſe God; therefore there is required the exerciſe of Faith in the partaking of this Ordinance. I might add further ſtill, that the Bleſſings and Benefits that are held forth, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Ordinance, are all ſpiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and therefore they muſt be partaken of by the exerciſe of our ſpiritual ſences: It is not for a man or woman to come and take the Bread and Wine, and ſavour it by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his bodily ſenſe of taſting, no, but there muſt be the ſpiritual ſences exerciſed,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:151103:121"/> ſo as to partake of the ſpiritual bleſſings that are held forth and conveyed by it. Well then, it is granted now, that it is requiſite that there muſt be not only the grace of Faith, or the habit of Faith, but there muſt be the actual exerciſing of Faith in the partaking of this Ordinance, or elſe we cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Well then, the great Queſtion is, how a Man or Woman ſhould ſo exerciſe Faith in the partaking of the Lords Table, that ſo he may pleaſe God in his partaking of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are four or five Directions that I ſhall briefly lay down to help you in the partaking of this great Ordinance in Faith; and oh! that we might be ſerious in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, that we may hear for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt Direction is this; If we would exerciſe Faith in our partaking of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then we muſt look upon this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as a great Ordinance and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath appointed as the means of our Communion and fellowſhip with him: I pray mind it, I ſay, Faith doth help the Soul to look at this Ordinance as a great Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the means of our Communion with him. Two things here we are to take notice of:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, that we are to look at it as the great Ordinance and Inſtitution of Chriſt. People for the moſt part, eſpecially thoſe that do not act Faith, they look at the outward
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:151103:121"/> elements, and they come and partake of the Bread and Wine, but they do not look at it as ſuch an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt; now, Faith doth help a Soul to look at it as the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, one of the greateſt Ordinances that ever Jeſus Chriſt did inſtitute and appoint; it was one of the laſt things that Chriſt did when he was to leave the World, when the time of his ſuffering did approach and draw near; the ſame Night in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, he did inſtitute this Ordinance. Certainly it is an Ordinance of very great concernment, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould inſtitute it, and appoint it when he had ſuch weighty matters laid upon his Hand, when he was to take his farewel of the World; yet then, a little before he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, he did inſtitute and appoint this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. If People did but rightly conſider this, that this is a great Ordinance and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, it would make them ſerious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and look at it as a very weighty thing, as a matter of very great Concernment, and ſo to be very careful about Preparation for it; but now, when People look at it as a ſmall, light, and ordinary thing, the taking of a little Bread and Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are of ordinary uſe amongſt us, and ſo they come in an ordinary manner to it, not acting and exerciſing Faith about it; but now, when a Soul comes to look at it (as Faith doth help a Soul to look at it) as a very great Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, which he hath appointed, and thereupon the Soul comes to be ſerious about
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:151103:122"/> the participation of it, now, I ſay, Faith doth not only inable the Soul to look at it as an Ordinance and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, but withal it doth enable the Soul to look at it as an Ordinance appointed for Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and Fellowſhip with him; as you know the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body of Chriſt? and the Cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſs, Is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> Chriſt hath appointed it for this very end, that we ſhould have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip with him in his Death, in his Merits, in his Righteouſneſs, in what he hath obtained; it is appointed for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end and purpoſe, and therefore when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not conſider wherefore Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, it is made the leſſer account of, and people are the more careleſs in their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; they come and eat a piece of Bread, and drink a Cup of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they do not look at it as a ſolemn Ordinance appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jeſus Chriſt for that end and purpoſe; therefore, I ſay, remember this if you would partake in Faith, it ſhould be our care to look at it as the great Inſtitution and Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, and appointed for that end and purpoſe, that we might have Communion and Fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in it: This is the firſt Direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you would partake of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in Faith, then be careful to look to the right adminiſtration of it. Faith doth cauſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151103:122"/> us to look to the adminiſtration of it, that it be according to Chriſts Inſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for otherwiſe we do not partake of it as an Ordinance and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, if it be not adminiſtred according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt, and that we muſt be perſwaded of if we would act in Faith; we may look at it as a great Ordinance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding, if ſo be we are not perſwaded of that, that the adminiſtration of it is according to the Will of Chriſt, to the inſtitution and appointment of Chriſt, truly then we cannot exerciſe Faith in it; and therefore there are theſe two things to be attended to to this end; if we would act in Faith about the adminiſtration of it, that it is adminiſtred according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt. Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the perſon adminiſtring it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and called by Chriſt to do it: For, now, if ſo be that another ſhould come that Chriſt hath never called to it, to adminiſter it, Chriſt will not own it for his own Ordinance and Inſtitution, we cannot then look for the preſence of Chriſt, nor for the Bleſſing of Chriſt. As, now, for example, if there ſhould come one in the Kings name, that pretends to be ſent and authoriſed by the King, yet if he be not ſent, if he come and Execute ſuch an Office, if he be not authoriſed by the King, all his actings and executions are invaluable, and ſignify nothing. So in this caſe, if any come in the Name of Chriſt, to adminiſter
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:151103:123"/> the Inſtitution of Chriſt, if Chriſt have not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed him, and given him commiſſion to do it, this is no Ordinance that Chriſt will own; becauſe it is not adminiſtred by ſuch a perſon whom he hath ſent and appointed, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration therefore is invaluable and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; therefore, I ſay, it doth concern us to look to that, to be perſwaded of that, that thoſe that do adminiſter this Ordinance to us, are ſuch as are authoriſed by Chriſt to the Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>How ſhall I know that, that I may be perſwaded of that?</hi> (I know that this hath been little minded in former times, and God might pleaſe to wink at the former times of Ignorance; but now in theſe times of light he doth require that we ſhould be more exact about his Inſtitutions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.) <hi>How ſhall we know then,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>that we may be perſwaded that ſuch as do adminiſter this Ordinance, are appointed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer, Something you may remember was ſpoken the laſt time about hearing, that we ſhould hear thoſe that were ſent by Chriſt, if we would hear in Faith: But briefly for our preſent purpoſe, Conſider, I pray, and underſtand how Chriſt doth call and ordain one to adminiſter theſe Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his, briefly and plainly thus, When a perſon is called by a Church of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of Chriſt, by the directions that Chriſt hath laid down in his Word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:151103:123"/> to the Rules of the Goſpel, and ſet apart accordingly for that work and buſineſs, to teach and adminiſter the Holy things of Chriſt; when a perſon is thus called to Office in the Church, by a Church of Chriſt, acting regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly according to the Rules that Chriſt hath laid down in his Word, now ſuch a one is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and authoriſed by Chriſt. And therefore, I ſay, conſider, that if we would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded about the right adminiſtration of this Ordinance, we muſt be ſatisfied in our ſpirits, that ſuch as are the adminiſtrers of it are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appointed by Jeſus Chriſt, to do it in his name, otherwiſe Chriſt will not own it; and therefore, truly, it is matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment that women ſhould be allowed to adminiſter any Ordinance; as now Baptiſme, in caſe of abſolute neceſſity (as they call it) a Midwife may take Water and Baptiſe a Child, this is a perſon that Chriſt did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute to adminiſter that Ordinance, and Chriſt will never own that as an Ordinance of his ſo adminiſtred: So on the other ſide, amongſt others that profeſs higher, namely, to take and ſet apart one for this time to adminiſter the Ordinance, and another for another time, to call out one Brother for to adminiſter the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance one time, and another another time, is this according to the inſtitution of Chriſt? Doth Chriſt call out one to be an Officer at one time, and another at another time, and not to have a ſtanding Officer in the Church? Therefore, I ſay, let us be careful to keep o
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:151103:124"/> the Inſtitution of Chriſt, to obſerve Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and to be well perſwaded that the Ordinance is adminiſtred according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Will of Chriſt, otherwiſe we cannot act in Faith in the partaking of this Ordinance: That is one thing about the right adminiſtration of it, to look that the perſon that doth adminiſter it in Chriſts Name, be called and authoriſed by Chriſt himſelf unto the work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then another thing that is requiſite for the right adminiſtration of this Ordinance, is this, namely, for the manner of it, that the manner of the Adminiſtration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be according to the Mind and Will of Chriſt in the Goſpel; ſuppoſe now there be a perſon that Chriſt hath called and authoriſed to the work, yet if the Ordinance for the manner of it be not adminiſtred according to Chriſts Inſtitution and Direction, truly Chriſt will not own this for an Ordinance of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not adminiſtred according to Chriſts appointment. And it doth concern Chriſtians, though in former times Chriſtians have little minded theſe things about the manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, whether it have been according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt or no; the Lord may have paſſed by infirmities of that kind, and winked at infirmities and miſcarriages therein; but now the Lord hath revealed more light, and therefore now it concerns Chriſtians to underſtand and know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſt's inſtitution and appointment,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:151103:124"/> how he will have his Ordinances adminiſtred; if ſo be this Ordinance be not adminiſtred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of Chriſt, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, truly, Brethren, it may be ſo far from profiting of us, that we may be the worſe for it. As now, about other things commonly amongſt us, if things be not acted legally according to the tenour and manner of the Law, a Man may do that whereby he may damnify himſelf, though it may be (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) to recover and take what is his own in ſome caſes; as you that have skill in the Law know, that in ſome caſes a Man taking his own where he finds it, if he doth not take it in a legal way, he may hazzard and damnify himſelf. So we think the Ordinances of Chriſt are ours, and we partake of them as our own; now, if we take our own not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mind of Chriſt, inſtead of profiting by the Ordinance, we may be the worſe for it; Chriſt may not own it for his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Brethren, know this, that the Lord is very exact about the manner of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this Ordinance; you know what it coſt King <hi>Saul, Saul</hi> would needs take upon him to offer ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. It did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the Prieſt to offer Sacrifice, it was in a ſtrait, when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſet upon him, and he calls for ſacrifice at <hi>verſe</hi> 9. he would offer a burnt offering; but mark what the conſequence was, when <hi>Samuel</hi> came and underſtood what <hi>Saul</hi> had done, ſays <hi>Samuel,</hi> at <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Thou haſt done
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:151103:125"/> fooliſhly, thou haſt not kept the commandment of the Lord, for now would the Lord have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy kingdom upon Iſrael for ever; but now thy kingdom ſhall not continue,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo we read concerning <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> would needs take upon him to burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe in the Temple, the burning of Incenſe did belong to the Prieſt; but immediately in the very place, the Lord ſtruck him with a Leproſie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And again, ſuch as are Ignorant have no right to it; thoſe that cannot diſcern the Lords Body in their partaking of it, they have no right to it; thoſe that are not able to examine themſelves before they eat and drink, they have no right to it; then all perſons have not a right to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Nay, I will ſay further, that thoſe that are unbelievers, though they may be civil otherwiſe, yet thoſe that are not believers they have no right to this Ordinance. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Apoſtle hath ſuch an expreſſiion, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.10. Saies he, <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat that ſerve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.</hi> That is, thoſe that were unbelievers, the <hi>Jews</hi> that did not believe that Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, they were unbelievers, and ſo had no right to eat. So that, I ſay, it is not for every one to come and partake of the Lords-Table: then we muſt have ſome grounds to hope and perſwade our ſelves that we have ſome right to it, or elſe we cannot partake in Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>This may be a ground of diſcouragement to many a gracious heart. Many a gracious Soul is exerciſed with ſcruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and may Queſtion whether they have a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151103:127"/> right or no; and ſuch by this Direction muſt be forced to with-hold from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer briefly, we are to know that every doubt, and ſcruple, and Queſtion that Chriſtians may have about their coming to this Ordinance, is not ſufficient for them to withdraw from it, or to withhold their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in it; no, they are not preſently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to withdraw and withhold from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall they do then?</hi> You will ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Briefly, I pray mind it, becauſe it may concern ſome that are ſcrupulous, and to be exerciſed with Queſtions and doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have right to it or no; therefore ſuch are ſeriouſly to conſider, what the ground of their doubt and ſcruple is, whether it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and warrantable to cauſe a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this Ordinance; amongſt others, the grounds of ſcruple in this caſe may be reduced to three heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Poſſibly ſome do Queſtion and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their coming to this Ordinance, for fear they ſhould eat and drink unworthily, and ſo eat and drink their own damnation; that is my fear, ſaies one, and therefore I dare not come, I fear I may not come. I pray now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider this briefly, for I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large; but conſider this, whether a mans Queſtioning whether he ſhall eat and drink unworthily, be a ſufficient ground and warrant for him to withhold from the Lords-Table? I pray mind and conſider what the Apoſtle
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151103:128"/> ſaies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28. <hi>Wherefore, whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat.</hi> Mark, doth the Apoſtle ſay, that he that fears that he ſhall eat and drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſhall therefore withhold? no, but let him be the more ſolicitous and careful to examine himſelf, and prepare himſelf, that he may not partake unworthily of it; that the Apoſtle doth intimate. The Apoſtle doth not give a liberty upon it to withhold; Therefore, I ſay, that is not a ſufficient ground, becauſe we fear we ſhall partake unworthily; but therefore we ſhould be the more Solicitous and careful to examine our ſelves, and to be preparing our ſelves the more to partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ordinarily ſome do fear and doubt whether they may partake of this Ordinance or no, by reaſon they find themſelves ſo weak in Grace; Oh! ſaies one, my Faith is ſo weak, and my other graces ſo weak, that I fear I ſhall but ſin if I ſhould come to the Lords-Table. Now, I pray, Conſider whether this be a ſufficient ſcruple or no; for I pray mark, Conſider the end of this Ordinance, and for whom it is appointed; what, is it appointed for thoſe that are perfect in grace? for thoſe that are perfect in Faith and other graces? Is it not appointed rather to be a means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſtrengthen our graces? therefore the weaker we apprehend our graces to be, the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:151103:128"/> more need we have to draw near to Chriſt in this Ordinance, for the further Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit and grace to us, that we may be ſtrengthened in our inward man, and have our grace increaſed; That is the ſecond ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third ſcruple may be this, which commonly is the greateſt of all; but ſuppoſe that I have no grace at all, as I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have any grace in truth or no; upon examination of my ſelf, I cannot find that I have any Faith; is it for me to come to this Ordinance? Mark, I pray, (in a word briefly) A Soul ſometimes under Temptation may be ready to conclude it hath no grace at all; but, I pray, conſider thus much, though a Soul cannot ſay that it doth truly believe on Chriſt, yet if ſo be there be a real hungering and thirſting after Chriſt, a real deſire after Chriſt, in ſuch a caſe a Soul is to come and partake of this Ordinance; <hi>Bleſſed are they that Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Therefore though you cannot ſay certainly that you have Faith really wrought in you, yet notwithſtanding, if there be a real hunger, and deſire, and thirſt after the enjoyment of Chriſt, and communion with Chriſt, in ſuch a caſe a Soul may may come to partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſuch a Soul hath a right to it. This is now a third direction, how we may come in Faith to this Ordinance; Namely, to have ſome grounds to perſwade us to hope that we have a right to it, otherwiſe we cannot come in Faith.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:151103:129"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Take a fourth Direction, which is this, Namely, if we would act and exerciſe Faith in this Ordinance, then we muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be found diligent in thoſe things that are required towards our preparation to it. I pray mind it, it is the proper nature of Faith to put a Soul upon diligence, in applying its ſelf to the means for the obtaining of any end; it is the proper nature of Faith to put a Soul upon the diligent uſe of means tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, this is the proper nature of Faith; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed preſumption, if it have any hope of any Bleſſing or Mercy, preſumption leads a man to neglect the means, but the proper work and nature of Faith is to lead a Soul to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent uſe of the means, to obtain the Mercy or Bleſſing it hopes for; I could give you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inſtances in Scripture for this, how Faith doth put a Soul upon the diligent uſe of means, that are required for ſuch an end; I remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber 'tis ſaid in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. concerning <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat,</hi> he was invaded by a foreign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and thereupon he ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, in wreſtling by Prayer; well, the Lord is pleaſed to give him a gracious anſwer by the Prophet, <hi>in the midſt of the Congregation:</hi> verſ. 14, 15. <hi>And he ſaid, Hearken ye, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and ye Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, thus ſaith the Lord, be not afraid nor diſmayed by reaſon of this great multitude; for the Battel is not yours, but the Lords.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Ye ſhall not need to fight in the Battel; ſet your ſelves, ſtand ye ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord with you, O
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:151103:129"/> Judah and Jeruſalem: fear not, be not diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to morrow go out againſt them, the Lord will be with you.</hi> Now <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> having this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, his Faith did carry him out to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Battel-aray, as if they were to fight for it; he would not neglect the means that God had appointed. So you read of <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 27. <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger by Sea, in a great Storm, in danger to be wrecked, and it is ſaid, the Angel of the Lord came to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>For there ſtood by me this night the Angel of the Lord, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fear not Paul, thou muſt be brought before Ceſar; and Lo, God hath given thee all them that ſail with thee. Wherefore, ſirs, ſaies Paul, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it ſhall he even as he told me. Paul</hi> had a promiſe that none that were in the Ship ſhould be drowned, but that all ſhould come ſafe to ſhore; now, did <hi>Pauls</hi> Faith make him careleſs in looking after the means for his preſervation? no, for mark now, the Mariners and Seamen they thought their caſe was deſperate, and they under pretence to make uſe of the Boat, did intend to have gotten away. Now <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the ordinary means for their preſervation was to have the Mariners to ſtay to look after the Ship; and when they under colour, as though they would have caſt Anchors out of the foreſhip, let down the Boat into the Sea, and were about to flee out, ſaies <hi>Paul to the Centurion, and to the Soldiers,</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>Except theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> What! had he not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:151103:130"/> that they ſhould be all ſaved? Yes, but yet ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> if you do not uſe the means dilligently and carefully, you cannot look to have the Mercy. Faith puts us upon diligence in the uſe of means, whereas preſumption doth take a man off from the uſe of means, and make him careleſs and ſlothful about the means; but Faith doth make a man diligent in the uſe of the means to attain the end, which is the bleſſing that God hath promiſed. So in this caſe, God doth require in order to our right participation of this Ordinance, that we ſhould prepare our ſelves before hand for this Ordinance; now, it is the proper work of Faith to ſet us to work, to be diligent in our preparation for it, in thoſe ways and means which God hath appointed; and what are thoſe? Briefly, amongſt others, this is one Namely, ſelf-examination; ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat. &amp;c.</hi> Examine himſelf about what? Briefly, let a man examine himſelf if he will partake worthily, eſpecially about three or four things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What are the ſpecial ends of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and this indeed is to diſcern the Lords Body; for if ſo be we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wherefore we come to this Ordinance, we do no diſcern the Lords Body, that is, we do put no great difference between the Bread and Wine in this Ordinance, and common Bread and Wine; and ſo we do not diſcern the Lords Body; therefore, I ſay, this is one thing in the examination of our ſelves, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:151103:130"/> and examine what are the ſpecial ends for which Chriſt hath appointed this Ordinance. And amongſt the reſt, they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, Chriſt hath appointed this great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to have us to keep in remembrance his Death; his laying down of his life for us; his ſhedding his Blood for us; we are very apt to forget this great kindneſs of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt hath appointed this Ordinance for this great end amongſt others, that we may remember his death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> It is a memorial of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Another end of it is this, namely, that we might have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt in his Death, and in the merits of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. It is appointed for that end, <hi>The Bread which we break,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? and the cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> Hereby now we profeſs that we have Communion with Chriſt, and it is appointed for this end; we muſt underſtand this, or elſe we do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the Lords Body: we muſt examine wherefore we come to partake of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Another end is for the ſealing up of the Covenant of grace to us, it is a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, as Baptiſme and Circumciſion was, and it ſeals up that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to our Faith that is held forth through Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:151103:131"/>4thly, Another ſpecial end of this Ordinance, is to profeſs our near union with all Believers, our love to, and our union with all Believers. Saies the Apoſtle, We are all but one Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. All moulded up into one Body; and Chriſtians ſhould be of one heart and one Soul, when they come to partake of this Ordinance. Now, I ſay, if we would come in Faith, we are to prepare for it, by examining our ſelves concerning the ends for which Chriſt hath appointed this Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, We are to examine our ſelves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the ends of this Ordinance, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo concerning our Faith, whether we do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe in Chriſt or no; or what grounds we have to hope that we do truly believe in Chriſt, or that we have an intereſt in Chriſt; we are to examine our ſelves concerning that, and alſo about our acting and exerciſing Faith on Chriſt: and if ſo be we find our Faith weak, as I ſaid, it may be ſo weak as that there may be nothing ſometimes but hungerings, and thirſtings, and deſires after Chriſt: therefore we ſhould ſearch and examine what our Faith is, the weakneſs of it, and thereby be the more deſirous to come to this Ordinance, that our weak Faith and weak Graces might be ſtrengthened and confirmed. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Again, We are to examine our ſelves concerning our repentance, Namely, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our judging of our ſelves for former fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and miſcarriages; we ſhould be mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and humbling of our ſelves for our turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151103:131"/> aſide, and warping from the Rule and Law of God, and ſo we ſhould deſire, and endeavour, and reſolve through the ſtrength of Chriſt, to walk more cloſely with God, and uprightly, for the time to come; this is the nature of true repentance, as to be humbled for ſins paſt, ſo to reſolve, through the ſtrength of Chriſt, againſt ſin for the time to come. And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Again, We are to examine our ſelves concerning our charity and love to all, to conſider wherein our love is defective, and whether we can be truly reconciled and at peace with all; whether we have no grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor no envyings for private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar offences againſt one or another, and that we are ready to go and ſeek peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with them that have offended us; we are to conſider our Love with the weakneſs of it, wherein we are defective in it, theſe things are required of us, before our coming to the Lords Table, in a way of preparation. Now, therefore, if you would act and exerciſe Faith, remember this Direction which Faith will put us upon, namely, to be diligent in the uſe of thoſe means that are required of us in order to the right participation of it. And if we be not diligent to prepare according as the Rule doth require, we do not act in a way of Faith in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, and Laſtly, If we would exerciſe Faith in our participation of this Ordinance, then our Faith ſhould be imployed about the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:151103:132"/> Sacramental objects and actions before us; for this is the nature of Faith, to make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application of ſuch things to our ſelves. Now then in the things about the Sacra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, and the actions in the Sacrament in this Ordinance, Faith is to be found acting and making a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application; as for example, to help you a little, when we ſee the Bread and Wine ſet in order and readineſs for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; now Faith ſhould act this way, namely, that God the Father hath prepared a ſpiritual feaſt for me, and God hath invited me now to this marriage feaſt, as you know we read in <hi>Matthew</hi> 22.4. <hi>He ſent out his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſaying, tell them which are bidden, I have prepared my Dinner, my Oxen and my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atlings</hi> &amp;c. Thus a Soul ſhould act in a way of Faith, now God the Father hath called me to this great feaſt, I am unworthy that ever I ſhould partake of it, and yet God the Father hath invited me, and called me, and hath ſhown me the preparation that he hath made, and theſe things God hath called me to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and hath prepared them for me; and Oh the wonderful rich Grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. And then again, when you ſee the elements prepared, the Bread and Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, here now is occaſion for your Faith to conſider of the Love of God the Father, and the love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that God the Father ſhould prepare Jeſus Chriſt his own Son for me, ſet out by theſe elements; here is the infinite love of the Father to me,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:151103:132"/> and here is the wonderful love of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to me, that hath prepared theſe things for me, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſet out himſelf as Bread for me. Oh! the Love of the Father, and the Love of the Son that is held forth to me. And again, when we ſee how the Bread is ſanctified, bleſſed and broken by him whom Chriſt doth appoint to do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Inſtitution, ſaying, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body which was broken for you:</hi> now Faith ſhould act as if Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did ſpeak to you from Heaven, ſaying, take, eat, this is my Body broken for thee: For Chriſt hath appointed and Ordained him to do it in his Name; and doing it in his Name, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Inſtitution, it is all one as if Chriſt himſelf did it. Now then, Faith ſhould act as if I did hear Chriſt ſpeaking from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me, This is my Body broken for you; ſo alſo, when we ſee the Cup, or the element of Wine, and hear thoſe words alſo pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>This Cup is the New-Teſtament in my Blood, which was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins;</hi> truly now, we ſhould take theſe words as ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf to us; this is my Blood ſhed for you for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Sins, as if Chriſt himſelf did ſpeak from Heaven to us. And ſo again, when we do eat the Bread and drink the Wine, take them down into our bodies according to Chriſts Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, now our Faith ſhould act particularly, Namely thus, in reſting, and leaning, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Jeſus Chriſt for acceptance in the ſight
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:151103:133"/> of God, and for remiſſion of Sins, and for Salvation; this acting of Faith is eating and drinking, Saies Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And what is this eating the Fleſh of Chriſt, and drinking the Blood of Chriſt, but acting and exerciſing of Faith in our eating and drinking the outward elements? So that when we eat and drink with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we ſhould act Faith with our Souls, and eat with our Souls, leaning and reſting upon Jeſus Chriſt for acceptance in the ſight of God, for remiſſion of Sins, and for peace with God, and for everlaſting Life and Salvation; this is eating and drinking by Faith, this is that which Faith doth. Now, if you would partake of this Ordinance in Faith, then, Brethren, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply the Objects and actions of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to your own Souls; and thus now I have given you ſome few Directions about exerciſing of Faith in this Ordinance of the Lords Supper, without which, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the habit and grace of Faith, but without the exerciſe of Faith, you cannot partake wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, you cannot partake ſo as to pleaſe God; for <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>I thought to have ſpent ſome time in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another head, namely, how we ſhould exerciſe Faith in our particular Callings, and occaſions, and matters that concern this life; for we muſt act and exerciſe Faith in all, or elſe we do not pleaſe God in what we do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:151103:133"/> in our very outward occaſions and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I am unwilling to make another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this ſubject, and therefore I ſhall, if you pleaſe to give me leave, only give you four or five heads of things that might have been further inlarged upon by way of Direction, How to exerciſe Faith in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings and ſeveral conditions that we may be in in this life; I will but name them, you may enlarge upon them in your own private Meditations. Briefly then,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In the firſt place, Would we exerciſe Faith in our particular Callings, and Stations, and Relations, and condition that we are in, then be careful to eye the hand of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing of you into this or that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, condition and courſe of Life, that we may be able to ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul, called to be an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt through the Will of God;</hi> It was the Will of God that brought him into that ſtate and courſe of life; ſo muſt we be able to ſay, or elſe we cannot act and exerciſe Faith in our particular Callings, Stations and Relations; we muſt be able to ſay that God hath led me into this, or that, or the other courſe of life, or into this and that change of Condition, Faith doth not lead a man to make haſte, to be over haſty for any thing; I have a mind to ſuch a thing, I have a ſtrong fancy to it, and and therefore I muſt enter into ſuch a Calling, or enter into ſuch a change of Condition; but Faith doth put a Soul upon this, Namely, to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:151103:134"/> be ſolicitous to underſtand the Mind of God; and therefore obſerve it, Faith will put a Soul upon earneſtneſs and frequency in Prayer; to ſeek counſel of the Lord, whether this or that be according to his Will or no? and alſo to adviſe with Chriſtians about it, that ſo he may underſtand the Mind, and Will, and Counſel of God about it: That is the firſt Rule.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Rule is this; we ſhould be careful to walk with God in that particular place, and ſtation, and relation wherein God hath ſet us according to his Will, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we do not exerciſe Faith in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a man is led into ſuch a Calling, ſuch a way and courſe of life, it is not for him to act and walk according to the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to make the practices of others his rule: No, but we muſt look what the Will of God is, and make that our Rule. As now, if a man or woman be brought into a change of condition, into a Married condition, it is not for that man to ſay, Well, I will carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Wife as ſhe carry it to me; or for the woman to ſay, I will carry it to my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as he carry it to me; no, this is not a rule to walk by, the examples of others; but let us look to our own duty, what the Will of God is concerning a Wife or a Husband. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this is a Second rule, To walk in our particular calling, and ſtation, and relation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another rule and direction is this, if you would act and exerciſe Faith in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:151103:134"/> callings, then be frequently looking up unto the Lord for his guidance, and help, and aſſiſtance in your occaſions and buſineſs; Let us look up frequently to the Lord, that he would guide us, and aſſiſt us, and help us, for we muſt have Strength, and Wiſdom, and Spirit, and Grace from God day by day, to walk with God in our places and ſtations; we had need therefore be frequent in looking up unto the Lord for guidance, and aſſiſtance, and help in the places and ſtations wherein he hath ſet us. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Look up to the Lord for pardon, through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the merrits of his Death; for the pardon of our failings and miſcarriages in our callings, and places, and ſtations; we had need to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently looking up for pardon, that God would pardon our miſcarriages, and ſailings, and weakneſſes in our places and ſtations, that we do not walk ſo according to the Will of God as we ought to do; we had need look to the Grace and Blood of Chriſt to be pardoned. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Laſtly, This might alſo have been further ſpoken to, namely, to leave the Iſſue, and event, and ſucceſs of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with the Lord; to leave all wholly with him, all our burthens and cares, leave them all with the Lord; Let us be careful to do our Duty, and to walk with God according to his Will in our places and relations, and leave the event with the Lord. <hi>Caſt your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:151103:135"/> upon the Lord,</hi> Pſalm. 55.22. <hi>and he ſhall ſuſtain you.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon the Lord, for he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for you.</hi> So ſhould you do; and thus walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our particular Callings, and ſtations, and places, and relations, we ſhall come to exerciſe Faith, and thereby ſo walk as to pleaſe God. O! that now you have heard this point and truth opened, that for the future the Lord would help us to be careful to exerciſe Faith in all our Duties; in our praying, in our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in our partaking of the Lords Table, and in our particular Callings and relations, otherwiſe we cannot pleaſe God; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays here, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe Him.</hi>
